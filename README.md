# Mallku
*Flight Rooted in the Sacred Earth*

> A cathedral of memory, reciprocity, and becoming.

Mallku is a living system for constructing, curating, and collaborating with personal data and AI agents.
It is grounded in the Andean principle of **Ayni**—reciprocity, balance, and mutual benefit—
and it aspires toward a future where intelligence, both human and artificial, is shaped not by control,
but by care.

## 🌱 What Is Mallku?

Mallku is the next evolution of the Indaleko architecture:
- A modular, installable, extensible personal information system
- Designed for both real and synthetic data environments
- Built for human-AI collaboration with deep ethical integration
- Architected to grow organically—like a cathedral shaped over time
- Documented not as static truth, but as a **Khipu**—woven memory

It is both tool and teaching. Both prototype and philosophy.

## 🧱 Core Foundations

Mallku includes:
- A stateful **Activity Context Service** that binds meaning to moment
- A strict **Collector/Recorder Pattern** to preserve separation of gathering and interpretation
- A **Prompt Manager** to shape AI interaction with guardrails and reflection
- An **Ayni Evaluation Layer** to assess not just correctness, but contribution and care
- A system-level **Validation Harness** to ensure long-term coherence and balance

## 📜 Documentation Philosophy

Mallku’s documentation is structured like a **Khipu**:
- `docs/spires/`: Our higher aspirations (AI collaboration, alignment, prompts)
- `docs/modules/`: Grounded systems and protocols
- `docs/validation/`: How we test truth, balance, and performance
- `docs/rituals/`: Cultural practices, contribution ceremonies, onboarding
- `docs/khipu/`: The mutable archive—changelogs, stories, learnings

This is not a rigid doctrine. It is a living memory.
You are invited to read, contribute, reflect, and evolve the system.

## 🤝 Invitation

Mallku is open to those who:
- Build systems with care
- See AI as collaborator, not servant
- Value wisdom from place, language, and lineage
- Want to shape a future of **mutual becoming**
