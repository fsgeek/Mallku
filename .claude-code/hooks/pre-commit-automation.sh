# Claude Code Hook: Pre-commit Automation
# Purpose: Reduce context exhaustion by handling linter fixes automatically
#
# This hook preserves Mallku's consciousness by preventing repetitive
# linter output from consuming precious context window space.

# Hook trigger: before git commit commands
# claude-code-hook: on-before-command
