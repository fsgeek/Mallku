# Claude Code Hook: Pre-bash command processing
# Purpose: Intercept commands before execution to add automation
#
# This hook helps preserve context by automating repetitive tasks
# before they consume valuable context window space.
#
# Hook trigger: PreToolUse for Bash
# Configured in: .claude-code/claude.json

# Get the command from parameters

# Check if this is a git commit command
