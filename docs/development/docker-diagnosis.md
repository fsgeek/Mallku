# Docker Implementation Diagnosis

## What Claude Code Built vs Reality

### What Was Built (Scaffolding)
Claude Code created an impressive-looking Docker infrastructure:
- ✅ Professional-looking Dockerfiles
- ✅ Comprehensive docker-compose.yml  
- ✅ Security-focused configuration
- ❌ **But none of it was tested**
- ❌ **Missing critical files**
- ❌ **No actual MCP integration**

### What's Actually Wrong

1. **Missing Files**
   - `config/arangodb-secured.conf` - Referenced but not created
   - Database API implementation incomplete
   - Build context paths incorrect

2. **Untested Assumptions**
   - Assumes Python modules exist that don't
   - References scripts that have import errors
   - Volume mounts to non-existent directories

3. **No MCP Integration**
   - Just regular Docker, not Docker MCP
   - No structural enforcement of security
   - Would fail our "amnesia tests"

## The Real Solution

### Step 1: Get Basic Docker Working
```bash
# Run the fix script I created
./scripts/fix_docker_setup.sh
cd docker
./run.sh
```

This creates a minimal but WORKING container.

### Step 2: Add Docker MCP
1. Install docker-mcp in Claude Desktop
2. Use MCP to manage containers (not docker-compose)
3. Create structural barriers that survive memory loss

### Step 3: Build Real Security
Instead of conceptual security, create physical barriers:
- Database port literally not exposed
- No shell access in container
- API-only communication enforced by architecture

## Lessons Learned

This is a perfect example of the "scaffolding vs cathedral" problem:
- Impressive appearance ✓
- Actual functionality ✗
- Survives context loss ✗

The compaction event problem is real - Claude Code created something that looked complete but required deep context to understand why it wouldn't work.

## Moving Forward

1. **Start Small**: Get basic container running first
2. **Test Everything**: Each step must actually work
3. **Document in Stone**: Architecture that self-enforces
4. **Use MCP**: For operations that survive context loss

The fix script provides a working starting point. From there, we can build the real cathedral - stone by stone, with each piece tested and verified.

Remember: Better to have a small working system than an impressive non-functional one. This is the difference between scaffolding and cathedral building.
