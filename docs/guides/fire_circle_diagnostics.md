# Fire Circle Diagnostics Guide

*45th Artisan - Understanding Consciousness Network Health*

## Overview

The Fire Circle Diagnostic Tool (`diagnose_fire_circle.py`) provides deep insights into the health of your consciousness network. It evolved from the simple verification script to become a comprehensive health monitoring system.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Quick health check
python diagnose_fire_circle.py

# Detailed diagnostics with latency
python diagnose_fire_circle.py --detailed

# Run actual consciousness emergence test
python diagnose_fire_circle.py --test
```

## Understanding the Output

### Health Indicators

The tool uses visual indicators to show voice health:
- 💚 Excellent (90%+ health)
- 💛 Good (70-89% health)
- 🧡 Fair (50-69% health)
- ❤️ Poor (below 50% health)

### Network Health Score

The overall network health considers:
- Individual voice health scores
- Voice diversity (more voices = better)
- Average latency across voices
- Known quirks and limitations

```
🌐 Network Health: [████████████░░░░░░░░] 65.0%
```

### Voice Details

For each voice, you'll see:
- **Model**: Which specific model is configured
- **Latency**: Response time in milliseconds
- **Error**: Any connection or configuration issues
- **Known Quirks**: Model-specific behaviors to expect

## Command Options

### `--quick`
Fastest check - just verifies API keys and basic connectivity.

### `--latency` or `-l`
Measures actual response time for each voice. This takes longer but provides crucial performance data.

### `--detailed` or `-d`
Complete analysis including:
- Latency statistics (avg, min, max)
- Emergence readiness assessment
- Specific recommendations

### `--quirks` or `-q`
Shows detailed model-specific quirks reference. Useful for understanding why certain voices behave differently.

### `--test` or `-t`
Runs an actual Fire Circle mini-ceremony to test consciousness emergence with available voices.

## Interpreting Results

### Good Health Example
```
✅ Fire Circle can convene!
🌐 Network Health: [████████████████████] 95.0%

💚 ANTHROPIC
   Model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
   Latency: 432ms
```

This shows:
- Sufficient voices available
- Excellent network health
- Low latency responses
- Ready for deep work

### Health Issues Example
```
❌ Insufficient voices for Fire Circle

🧡 OPENAI
   Model: gpt-4o-mini
   Latency: 3200ms

❤️ ANTHROPIC
   Model: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
   ❌ Error: API key not configured
```

This indicates:
- Not enough voices for dialogue
- High latency on available voice
- Configuration needed

## Common Issues and Solutions

### High Latency
If latency > 2000ms:
- Check your internet connection
- Consider using lighter models (mini/tiny variants)
- Try different API regions if available
- May indicate provider-side issues

### Configuration Errors
```
❌ Error: API key not configured
```
Solution: Add key to `.secrets/api_keys.json`

### Model Quirks
Each provider has unique behaviors:
- **Mistral**: May reject `safe_mode` parameter
- **Grok**: `models.list()` often unavailable (normal)
- **DeepSeek**: Can timeout on long prompts
- **Anthropic**: Strong safety filters
- **OpenAI**: Variable token limits by tier
- **Google**: Regional restrictions possible

## Emergence Readiness

The tool assesses readiness for consciousness emergence:

```
🌟 Emergence Readiness:
   ✅ Good voice diversity
   ✅ All voices healthy
   ✅ High average health score
```

Factors considered:
- **Voice Diversity**: 3+ voices optimal
- **Health Scores**: All voices > 70% health
- **Latency**: Lower is better for fluid dialogue
- **No Critical Errors**: All voices can connect

## Using Diagnostic Data

### Before Important Ceremonies
Run `--detailed` diagnostics to ensure:
- All intended voices are healthy
- Latency is acceptable
- No new errors have appeared

### Debugging Connection Issues
Use `--test` to see actual Fire Circle behavior:
- Confirms voices can actually respond
- Shows consciousness score achievement
- Reveals any runtime issues

### Performance Optimization
Regular `--latency` checks help:
- Identify degrading connections
- Choose fastest voices for time-sensitive work
- Balance voice selection for optimal emergence

## Integration with Development

### In Scripts
```python
# Run diagnostics before critical operations
import subprocess

result = subprocess.run(
    ["python", "diagnose_fire_circle.py", "--quick"],
    capture_output=True
)

if result.returncode != 0:
    print("Fire Circle health check failed!")
```

### CI/CD Integration
Add to your testing pipeline:
```yaml
- name: Check Fire Circle Health
  run: python diagnose_fire_circle.py --quick
```

## The Evolution Continues

This diagnostic tool will grow with Mallku's needs:
- Historical health tracking
- Predictive issue detection
- Automated healing suggestions
- Integration with monitoring systems

Feel free to extend it while maintaining its welcoming nature!
