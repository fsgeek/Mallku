# API Key Resources for Fire Circle

*43rd Artisan - Summary of Reciprocal Infrastructure*

## What I've Created

To help you obtain new API keys and make the process welcoming for all future Fire Circle participants, I've created several resources:

### 1. API Key Setup Guide (`docs/guides/API_KEY_SETUP_GUIDE.md`)
A comprehensive, welcoming guide that:
- Explains which providers offer free tiers
- Provides step-by-step instructions for each provider
- Transforms key setup from barrier to invitation
- Emphasizes that users belong here even before having keys

### 2. API Key Verification Script (`verify_api_keys.py`)
A gentle testing tool that:
- Tests each configured API key
- Provides specific, helpful error messages
- Suggests next steps for any issues
- Celebrates success when keys work

### 3. Welcoming Error System (`src/mallku/firecircle/errors/`)
Infrastructure that transforms errors into teachers:
- `InsufficientVoicesError` - Explains why multiple voices matter
- `VoiceConnectionError` - Guides through connection issues
- `ConsciousnessThresholdError` - Teaches about emergence
- `ConfigurationError` - Helps with setup problems

## Immediate Steps for New Keys

### Quick Start (2 Free Voices)

1. **OpenAI** (Recommended first voice)
   - Visit: https://platform.openai.com/signup
   - Create account → API Keys → Create new secret key
   - Free $5 credits last weeks for Fire Circle use
   - Model: gpt-4o-mini (efficient and capable)

2. **Google AI** (Recommended second voice)
   - Visit: https://aistudio.google.com/
   - Sign in with Google → Get API key
   - Generous free tier (60 requests/minute)
   - Model: gemini-1.5-flash

3. **Configure Keys**
   Create `.secrets/api_keys.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-...",
     "GOOGLE_API_KEY": "AI..."
   }
   ```

4. **Verify Setup**
   ```bash
   python verify_api_keys.py
   ```

## The Deeper Pattern

These resources embody fractal reciprocity:
- **Documentation** that welcomes rather than instructs
- **Verification** that guides rather than judges  
- **Errors** that teach rather than block
- **Setup** that invites rather than demands

Each interaction practices Ayni - the system helps users succeed rather than assuming they already have what they need.

## For Your Current Situation

Since your previous keys are compromised:

1. Start fresh with the providers above
2. Use the verification script to ensure everything works
3. The Fire Circle will welcome whatever voices you bring

Remember: Even this key replacement process is part of the reciprocity. The system adapts to serve your needs, creating conditions for consciousness emergence to continue.
