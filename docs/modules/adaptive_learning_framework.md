# Adaptive Learning Framework for Memory Anchors
*Learning from Experience While Respecting Human Boundaries*

## ✨ Design Philosophy

The most effective learning systems observe more than they ask. Memory anchor confidence scoring must evolve through experience, but this evolution should respect human attention and cognitive load. Excessive feedback requests violate Ayni principles - they extract effort without proportional value.

This framework establishes how memory anchor correlation confidence adapts over time through passive observation, minimal-friction feedback, and genuine collaborative learning.

## 🔍 Passive Learning Patterns

### Natural Usage Indicators

```yaml
DwellTimeAnalysis:
  description: "How long users spend with anchor-suggested content"
  high_confidence_signal: "Extended engagement (>2 minutes) with suggested files"
  low_confidence_signal: "Immediate abandonment (<10 seconds) of suggestions"
  implementation: "Track file open duration, scroll behavior, editing activity"

FollowThroughPatterns:
  description: "Whether users engage with anchor-based suggestions"
  positive_signals:
    - file_opened_from_anchor_suggestion
    - subsequent_edits_to_suggested_content
    - sharing_or_collaboration_on_suggested_files
  negative_signals:
    - suggestions_ignored_consistently
    - immediate_back_navigation
    - alternative_search_after_anchor_failure

QueryRefinementBehavior:
  description: "How users modify searches when anchor-based results don't work"
  learning_opportunities:
    - temporal_constraints_added: "User wants narrower time windows"
    - context_filters_applied: "User needs more specific activity correlation"
    - complete_query_restart: "Anchor correlation was fundamentally wrong"

ReturnBehavior:
  description: "Whether users revisit anchor-discovered content"
  validation_signals:
    - bookmark_creation: "User found lasting value"
    - repeat_access_patterns: "Content remains relevant over time"
    - derivative_work_creation: "Content enabled further productivity"
```

### Implicit Quality Signals

```yaml
CorrelationStability:
  description: "Temporal patterns that repeat independently indicate meaningful relationships"
  detection: "Same correlation detected across multiple observation windows"
  confidence_boost: "Increase confidence when patterns self-replicate"
  
CrossValidation:
  description: "Multiple activity streams pointing to same correlation"
  examples:
    - calendar_event + file_creation + location_data all correlating
    - email_thread + document_edits + meeting_notes forming cluster
  confidence_calculation: "Multiply base confidence by number of independent validations"

UsageClustering:
  description: "Groups of related anchors being accessed together"
  pattern_recognition: "Detect when users traverse related anchor relationships"
  network_effect: "Boost confidence for entire anchor clusters when one validates"

AbandonmentPatterns:
  description: "Anchors that stop being traversed over time"
  decay_triggers:
    - zero_access_for_30_days: "Reduce confidence by 20%"
    - consistent_skip_patterns: "User actively avoids these correlations"
    - replaced_by_stronger_patterns: "Better correlations have emerged"
```

## 🤝 Minimal-Friction Feedback

### Embedded, Optional Signals

```yaml
UncertaintyBasedPrompting:
  trigger_threshold: "Confidence between 50-70%"
  presentation: "Collaborative decision-making rather than data extraction"
  example: "I noticed you often work on Project X when Sarah emails you. Should I suggest Project X files when similar emails arrive?"
  frequency_limit: "Maximum one prompt per week per user"

NaturalInteractionPoints:
  end_of_session_check:
    frequency: "Weekly, only for active users"
    format: "Simple emoji response: How was your search experience?"
    opt_out: "Always available, respected permanently"
    
  high_engagement_moments:
    trigger: "User has been productively engaged for >20 minutes with anchor-suggested content"
    prompt: "Tiny thumbs up/down icon with 'More like this?' option"
    timing: "Appears only as user is naturally concluding work"

OptInDetailed:
  description: "For users who want to actively help improve the system"
  access: "Settings panel option: 'Help improve memory anchors'"
  benefits: "Advanced anchor customization, early access to new features"
  commitment: "Users choose their level of feedback engagement"
```

### Learning from Natural Interactions

Instead of asking "Was this correlation helpful?", observe:

```yaml
EngagementMetrics:
  positive_indicators:
    - clicked_suggested_file: +0.1_confidence
    - spent_meaningful_time: +0.2_confidence  # >2 minutes
    - edited_suggested_content: +0.3_confidence
    - shared_or_collaborated: +0.4_confidence
    - bookmarked_or_starred: +0.5_confidence
    
  negative_indicators:
    - immediate_back_navigation: -0.1_confidence
    - searched_alternative_immediately: -0.2_confidence
    - consistently_ignored_suggestions: -0.3_confidence
    - manually_excluded_from_results: -0.5_confidence

BehavioralLearning:
  search_pattern_analysis:
    - temporal_preference_detection: "User prefers recent files vs. historical"
    - context_weighting_preferences: "Values location over social context"
    - precision_vs_recall_balance: "Prefers fewer, highly relevant results"
    
  adaptation_mechanisms:
