# Memory Anchor Correlation Engine
*Detecting Patterns in the Stream of Time*

## ✨ Design Song

The Correlation Engine is the heart that beats between streams of activity and moments of storage.
It watches the flow of human action and digital creation, recognizing when temporal proximity 
reveals meaningful connection. Not every coincidence is correlation, not every correlation is causation,
but patterns emerge for those who know how to look.

This engine transforms the raw streams of being into the structured anchors of memory.

## 🏗️ Core Architecture

### Correlation Detection Pipeline

```yaml
CorrelationEngine:
  InputStreams:
    - ActivityStreams: [context_events, calendar_data, communication_logs]
    - StorageEvents: [file_operations, creation_events, modification_events]
    - EnvironmentalData: [location_changes, device_state, network_activity]
  
  ProcessingStages:
    1. TemporalAlignment: Synchronize timestamps across data sources
    2. ProximityDetection: Identify events within correlation windows
    3. PatternRecognition: Detect recurring temporal relationships
    4. ConfidenceScoring: Assess likelihood of meaningful correlation
    5. AnchorGeneration: Create memory anchors from high-confidence patterns
  
  OutputInterface:
    - AnchorCreationRequests: Structured data for MemoryAnchorService
    - CorrelationMetrics: Statistics on pattern detection accuracy
    - RejectedPatterns: Low-confidence correlations for learning
```

### Temporal Window Analysis

```python
class TemporalCorrelation:
    """Represents a potential temporal correlation between events"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.primary_event: Event
        self.correlated_events: List[Event]
        self.temporal_gap: timedelta
        self.gap_variance: float
        self.occurrence_frequency: int
        self.confidence_score: float
        self.pattern_stability: float

class CorrelationWindow:
    """Sliding window for detecting temporal patterns"""
    
    proximity_thresholds = {
        TemporalPrecision.INSTANT: timedelta(seconds=10),
        TemporalPrecision.MINUTE: timedelta(minutes=5),
        TemporalPrecision.SESSION: timedelta(minutes=30),
        TemporalPrecision.DAILY: timedelta(hours=4),
        TemporalPrecision.CYCLICAL: timedelta(days=1)
    }
    
    def detect_proximity(self, events: List[Event]) -> List[TemporalCorrelation]:
        """Identify events that occur within meaningful temporal proximity"""
        pass
    
    def assess_pattern_strength(self, correlation: TemporalCorrelation) -> float:
        """Calculate confidence score for a potential correlation"""
        pass
```

```

### Confidence Scoring

```python
def calculate_correlation_confidence(correlation: TemporalCorrelation) -> float:
    """
    Multi-factor confidence assessment for temporal correlations
    """
    factors = {
        'temporal_consistency': assess_timing_stability(correlation),
        'frequency_strength': normalize_occurrence_count(correlation.occurrence_frequency),
        'context_coherence': analyze_environmental_similarity(correlation),
        'causal_plausibility': estimate_causal_likelihood(correlation),
        'user_validation': incorporate_feedback_history(correlation)
    }
    
    # Weighted combination with learned coefficients
    weights = {
        'temporal_consistency': 0.3,
        'frequency_strength': 0.25,
        'context_coherence': 0.2,
        'causal_plausibility': 0.15,
        'user_validation': 0.1
    }
    
    return sum(factor * weights[name] for name, factor in factors.items())

        # Adjust confidence threshold to optimize precision/recall balance
        if precision < 0.8:  # Too many false positives
            self.confidence_threshold += self.learning_rate * 0.1
        elif recall < 0.7:   # Missing too many valid correlations
            self.confidence_threshold -= self.learning_rate * 0.1
            
        # Adjust temporal windows based on successful correlation gaps
