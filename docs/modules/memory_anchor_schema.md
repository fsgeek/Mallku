# Memory Anchor Schema
*The Formal Foundation of Associative Memory*

## ‚ú® Design Song

Memory anchors are not metadata. They are not tags or labels or categories.
They are **utilitarian correlation tools** - the precise mechanisms that bind 
isolated events into meaningful temporal associations.

This schema defines memory anchors as focused infrastructure for temporal correlation,
with formal structure that enables both accurate pattern recognition and efficient graph traversal.
Each anchor holds the capacity for relationship - the ability to bind moments across time 
through the recognition of temporal proximity and contextual resonance.

## üèóÔ∏è Core Schema

### Memory Anchor Entity

```yaml
MemoryAnchor:
  # Identity and lifecycle
  id: UUID                    # Unique identifier

### Anchor Types

```yaml
AnchorType:
  TEMPORAL:         # Time-based correlations
    description: "Events clustered by temporal proximity"
    examples: ["files created during meetings", "edits during travel"]
    
  CONTEXTUAL:       # Environmental/situational
    description: "Actions taken under similar circumstances"  
    examples: ["work done while listening to specific music", "focus sessions"]
    
  SEMANTIC:         # Content-meaning relationships
    description: "Connections based on content similarity or theme"
    examples: ["documents about same project", "images of same event"]
    
  SOCIAL:          # Human relationship contexts
    description: "Activities involving specific people or groups"
    examples: ["files shared with collaborators", "work done during conversations"]
    
  CAUSAL:          # Sequential dependencies
    description: "Events that trigger or result from other events"
    examples: ["email leads to document creation", "meeting spawns action items"]
    
  RITUAL:          # Repeated behavioral patterns
    description: "Recurring practices and workflows"
    examples: ["daily review sessions", "weekly planning rituals"]
```

## üåê Relationship Ontology

### Core Relationship Types

```yaml
# Mutual reinforcement - anchors that strengthen each other
STRENGTHENS:
  weight: float              # 0.0-1.0, bidirectional influence
  reinforcement_count: int   # Number of times co-activated
  last_reinforced: ISO8601   # Most recent mutual activation

# Temporal sequence - ordered relationships
PRECEDES:
  temporal_gap: duration     # Time between anchor activations
  sequence_strength: float   # Reliability of this ordering
  causal_confidence: float   # Likelihood of actual causation

# Contextual similarity - shared circumstances
RESONATES_WITH:
  similarity_dimensions: [string]  # What aspects align
  resonance_strength: float        # Degree of contextual overlap
  stability: float                 # Consistency over time

# Hierarchical relationships - part/whole structures  
CONTAINS:
  containment_type: ContainmentType  # spatial, temporal, semantic, social
  coverage: float                    # How much of child is contained
  
DERIVES_FROM:
  derivation_type: DerivationType    # specialization, generalization, transformation
  transformation_confidence: float   # Certainty of derivation

# Conflict and competition
CONFLICTS_WITH:
  conflict_type: ConflictType        # temporal, semantic, causal
  resolution_strategy: string        # How conflicts should be resolved
  
COMPETES_WITH:
  competition_dimension: string      # What they compete for (attention, resources)
  winner_determination: string       # How to choose between them
```

### Temporal Precision Levels

```yaml
TemporalPrecision:
  INSTANT:     # sub-second precision
    use_case: "File save events, keystroke patterns"
    
  MINUTE:      # minute-level grouping  
    use_case: "Brief focused activities, quick edits"
    
  SESSION:     # multi-minute work periods
    use_case: "Concentrated work blocks, meeting segments"
    
  DAILY:       # day-level patterns
    use_case: "Daily rhythms, routine activities"
    
  CYCLICAL:    # weekly/monthly patterns
    use_case: "Recurring meetings, periodic reviews"
```

## üîÑ Lifecycle Management

### Anchor Creation
- **Threshold-based**: Created when correlation strength exceeds minimum confidence
- **Pattern recognition**: Emerge from repeated temporal proximities  
- **Manual curation**: User or AI-assisted anchor creation
- **Import/migration**: From existing activity context data

### Strength Dynamics
- **Reinforcement**: Strength increases when patterns repeat
- **Decay**: Natural weakening over time without reinforcement
- **Boost**: Increases when correlations prove useful in queries
- **Suppression**: Reduction when patterns prove unreliable or noisy

### Pruning and Maintenance
- **Weakness threshold**: Anchors below minimum strength are archived
- **Redundancy detection**: Merge overly similar anchors
- **Conflict resolution**: Algorithmic approaches to competing interpretations
- **Archive rotation**: Long-term storage of historical patterns
- **Performance optimization**: Prune anchors that are computationally expensive but rarely useful

## üß≠ Integration Points

### With Query System  
- Natural language queries can traverse anchor relationships
