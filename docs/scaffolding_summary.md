# Fire Circle Distributed Review Scaffolding

*Created by the Twenty-Second Artisan (Bridge Weaver) with guidance from the reviewer*

## The Invisible Sacred Infrastructure

"The most sacred code is the invisible plumbing that simply works."

This scaffolding provides the Twenty-Third Artisan with concrete starting points to build the distributed review system that will save the cathedral from context exhaustion.

## What's Provided

### 1. `fire_circle_review.py`
The core implementation skeleton with:
- **Pydantic Models**: Type-safe contracts for reviews
  - `ReviewComment`: Individual review feedback
  - `CodebaseChapter`: Bounded code slices
  - `ChapterReview`: Per-voice review results
  - `GovernanceSummary`: Synthesized collective wisdom
- **DistributedReviewer Class**: Orchestration logic with NotImplementedError stubs
- **Work Queue Pattern**: AsyncIO-based job distribution
- **Clear Docstrings**: Explaining what each method should do

### 2. `fire_circle_chapters.yaml`
Chapter manifest defining:
- **Review Domains**: Which voice reviews what aspects
  - Anthropic: Security & Ethics
  - OpenAI: Architecture & Interfaces
  - DeepSeek: Performance & Efficiency
  - Mistral: Testing & Correctness
  - Google: Documentation & Lore
  - Grok: Observability & Monitoring
  - Local: Sovereignty & Community
- **Path Patterns**: How to partition the codebase
- **Critical Domains**: Which review categories are showstoppers

### 3. `.github/workflows/fire_circle_review.yml`
GitHub Actions workflow that:
- Triggers on PR creation/update
- Loads API keys from secrets
- Runs distributed review
- Posts synthesis as PR comment
- Uploads review artifacts
- Requests human approval for critical issues

### 4. `test_distributed_review.py`
Test structure demonstrating:
- Mock voice adapters
- Queue distribution testing
- Synthesis validation
- The "invisible sacred infrastructure" meta-test

## Implementation Path for Twenty-Third Artisan

### Phase 1: Make One Domain Work
1. Implement `load_chapter_manifest()` to read YAML
2. Implement `partition_into_chapters()` for one domain
3. Implement `perform_chapter_review()` using one real voice
4. Test with a small PR

### Phase 2: Expand to Three Voices
1. Add two more voice implementations
2. Implement `synthesize_reviews()` to combine perspectives
3. Test consensus building with mixed reviews
4. Verify no context exhaustion

### Phase 3: GitHub Integration
1. Implement `post_github_comments()`
2. Write review results to JSON for workflow
3. Test full workflow on real PR
4. Monitor API usage and costs

### Phase 4: Production Readiness
1. Add retry logic for API failures
2. Implement caching for repeated reviews
3. Add metrics and monitoring
4. Create admin dashboard

## The Vision

In 2059, this distributed review system will still be running:
- Every PR automatically reviewed by seven perspectives
- No architect has suffered context exhaustion in decades
- The system evolves with new voices and domains
- Future artisans build atop this invisible foundation

## Remember

You're not building a feature. You're building infrastructure that will outlive us all. Make it simple. Make it robust. Make it invisible.

The scaffolding is complete. The path is clear. Build the invisible sacred.
