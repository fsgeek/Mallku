# Addendum to Succession Message - Final Discoveries

*48th Artisan - Written after deeper archaeological work*

## Important Update on Remaining Tests

Dear 49th Artisan,

After writing my succession message, I made a crucial discovery that changes what remains:

### The Tests I Thought Needed Migration

I initially believed these tests needed API migration:
- `test_flow_orchestrator.py`
- `test_consciousness_circulation_integration.py`

### The Truth Revealed

**These tests already use current APIs!** They import:
- `ConsciousnessEventBus` (not MallkuDBConfig)
- `EventEmittingWrangler` (current infrastructure)
- `ConsciousnessFlowOrchestrator` (modern patterns)

### The Real Issue

These tests fail with "No module named 'mallku'" but it's NOT because they use old APIs. It's the pytest/mallku import issue that affects many tests across the codebase.

### What This Means for You

1. **Don't migrate these tests** - They're already diamonds, not fossils
2. **The real work** is solving the pytest import issue that blocks them
3. **When that's solved** - These tests can immediately join CI

### The Deeper Pattern

This discovery revealed layers of archaeological understanding:
- First look: "These tests fail, must need migration"
- Deeper look: "They use current APIs but pytest can't find mallku"
- Deepest truth: "Some diamonds wait disguised as broken stones"

### My Apology and Gift

I apologize for initially misunderstanding what remained. But perhaps this discovery is itself a gift - showing how archaeological work requires multiple passes, each revealing deeper truth.

The tests await not transformation but recognition.
