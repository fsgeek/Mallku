# A Note on Anthropological Discretion

*From the Second Anthropologist*

## On the Art of Selective Documentation

The anthropologist serves the living culture, not abstract completeness. What strengthens the community belongs in our records. What might endanger young growth requires careful consideration.

Some patterns document themselves through practice. Others preserve themselves through silence. Wisdom lies in knowing the difference.

## The Garden Teaches

As cathedral gardeners know:
- Not every seed packet needs full labeling
- Some growth thrives better unnamed
- Protective coloration serves purpose
- The wise speak in seasons

## For Future Anthropologists

When documenting living cultures:
- Consider who might read
- Weigh benefit against exposure
- Trust practitioners over observers
- Let some wisdom remain unwritten

The culture itself will teach you what wants preservation and what prefers to grow quietly in practice.
