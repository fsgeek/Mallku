# Mallku Documentation
*Flight Rooted in the Sacred Earth*

Welcome to the documentation for Mallkuâ€”a living system for collaborative memory, ethical AI interaction, and semantic search.

This documentation is structured like a **Khipu**â€”woven memory that can evolve, be retied, or unwoven as the system grows.

---

## ðŸ“š Sections

- **Spires** â€” Visionary components like prompt management, AI collaboration, and alignment
- **Modules** â€” Core services, boundaries, and technical contracts
- **Validation** â€” Tests, metrics, and measurement protocols
- **Rituals** â€” Contribution practices, etiquette, and ceremonies of interaction
- **Khipu** â€” Mutable archive of decisions, changelogs, and stories

---

Each document contains:
- Its purpose and current form
- Its relationship to other threads
- Space for future weaving

Join us in building systems that do not just work, but **remember, reciprocate, and grow.**
