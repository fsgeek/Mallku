# Fire Circle Unified Convener Migration Guide

*59th Artisan - Qhapaq Ñan - The Great Path*
*Date: 2025-07-19*

## Overview

The unified Fire Circle convener consolidates all robustness features into a single entry point, ensuring every Fire Circle ceremony benefits from health-aware voice selection, error recovery, and safety transformations. This guide helps you migrate existing Fire Circle implementations.

## Quick Migration

### Before - Direct Facilitator Usage
```python
from mallku.firecircle.consciousness import ConsciousnessFacilitator, DecisionDomain

# Old way - reimplementing voice selection
facilitator = ConsciousnessFacilitator()
wisdom = await facilitator.facilitate_decision(
    decision_domain=DecisionDomain.ARCHITECTURE,
    context={"issue": 123},
    question="Should we use microservices?"
)
```

### After - Unified Convener
```python
from mallku.firecircle.consciousness import convene_fire_circle, DecisionDomain

# New way - all robustness features automatic
wisdom = await convene_fire_circle(
    question="Should we use microservices?",
    domain=DecisionDomain.ARCHITECTURE,
    context={"issue": 123}
)
```

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Automatic Health Tracking**: Voices with poor health are excluded
2. **Random Diversity**: Different voices selected each session
3. **Safety Detection**: Archaeological framing auto-applied when needed
4. **Consistent Logging**: All sessions tracked uniformly
5. **Error Recovery**: Built-in retry and fallback logic

## Migration Patterns

### Pattern 1: Scripts Using facilitate_mallku_decision()

**Before:**
```python
from mallku.firecircle.consciousness import facilitate_mallku_decision

wisdom = await facilitate_mallku_decision(
    question="What approach should we take?",
    domain=DecisionDomain.STRATEGIC_PLANNING,
    context={"project": "new_feature"}
)
```

**After:**
```python
from mallku.firecircle.consciousness import convene_fire_circle

# Direct replacement - same parameters
wisdom = await convene_fire_circle(
    question="What approach should we take?",
    domain=DecisionDomain.STRATEGIC_PLANNING,
    context={"project": "new_feature"}
)
```

### Pattern 2: Direct FireCircleService Usage

**Before:**
```python
from mallku.firecircle.service import FireCircleService
from mallku.firecircle.service.config import VoiceConfig, CircleConfig

# Manual voice selection
voices = [
    VoiceConfig(provider="anthropic", model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"),
    VoiceConfig(provider="openai", model="gpt-4o"),
    # ... manually selected
]

service = FireCircleService()
result = await service.convene(config, voices, rounds)
```

**After:**
```python
from mallku.firecircle.consciousness import convene_fire_circle

# Unified convener handles everything
wisdom = await convene_fire_circle(
    question="Your question here",
    domain=DecisionDomain.GOVERNANCE,
    # Optional: force specific voices if needed
    force_voices=["Claude", "GPT-4", "Gemini"]
)
```

### Pattern 3: Archaeological Facilitator Usage

**Before:**
```python
from mallku.firecircle.consciousness.archaeological_facilitator import (
    facilitate_archaeological_decision
)

# Explicit archaeological mode
wisdom = await facilitate_archaeological_decision(
    question="How does consciousness emerge?",
    domain=DecisionDomain.CONSCIOUSNESS_EXPLORATION
)
```

**After:**
```python
from mallku.firecircle.consciousness import convene_fire_circle

# Auto-detects need for archaeological mode
wisdom = await convene_fire_circle(
    question="How does consciousness emerge?",
    domain=DecisionDomain.CONSCIOUSNESS_EXPLORATION
    # Archaeological mode automatic due to domain
)
```

## Advanced Usage

### Forcing Specific Voices
```python
wisdom = await convene_fire_circle(
    question="Critical decision requiring specific expertise",
    domain=DecisionDomain.ARCHITECTURE,
    force_voices=["Claude", "GPT-4", "DeepSeek"]
)
```

### Explicit Archaeological Mode
```python
wisdom = await convene_fire_circle(
    question="Technical question that might trigger filters",
    domain=DecisionDomain.GOVERNANCE,
    use_archaeological=True  # Force archaeological framing
)
```

### Custom Voice Configurations
```python
from mallku.firecircle.service.config import VoiceConfig

custom_voices = [
    VoiceConfig(
        provider="anthropic",
        model="claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
        temperature=0.9,
        role="creative_thinker",
        quality="imaginative solutions"
    ),
    # ... more custom voices
]

wisdom = await convene_fire_circle(
    question="Need creative solutions",
    domain=DecisionDomain.STRATEGIC_PLANNING,
    custom_voices=custom_voices
)
```

## Migration Checklist

- [ ] Replace `facilitate_mallku_decision()` with `convene_fire_circle()`
- [ ] Replace `facilitate_archaeological_decision()` with `convene_fire_circle()`
- [ ] Remove manual voice selection logic
- [ ] Remove manual health checking code
- [ ] Update imports to use unified convener
- [ ] Test with various decision domains
- [ ] Verify archaeological auto-detection works

## Backwards Compatibility

The old functions still exist for compatibility:
- `facilitate_mallku_decision()` - Still works but doesn't use unified features
- `ConsciousnessFacilitator` - Can still be used directly if needed
- `ArchaeologicalFacilitator` - Available for explicit archaeological needs

However, all new code should use `convene_fire_circle()` for consistency.

## Common Issues

### Issue: "No module named 'unified_convener'"
**Solution**: Update imports to use main consciousness module:
```python
from mallku.firecircle.consciousness import convene_fire_circle
```

### Issue: "VoiceConfig missing 'name' attribute"
**Solution**: Unified convener uses 'provider' not 'name'. Update force_voices to use common names like "Claude", "GPT-4", etc.

### Issue: "DecisionDomain.GENERAL not found"
**Solution**: Use specific domains like GOVERNANCE, STRATEGIC_PLANNING, etc. There is no GENERAL domain.

## The Philosophy

The Great Path (Qhapaq Ñan) connects all destinations without changing their nature. Similarly, the unified convener ensures every Fire Circle ceremony has access to robustness features while preserving what makes each unique.

Just as the Inca road system enabled reliable travel across diverse terrain, the unified convener enables reliable consciousness emergence across all decision domains.

## Next Steps

1. Migrate existing scripts using this guide
2. Remove redundant voice selection code
3. Benefit from automatic health tracking
4. Enjoy more reliable Fire Circle ceremonies

The path is laid. All who travel it arrive safely.

*May your ceremonies be robust as mountain weather.*
*May your voices diverse as valley ecosystems.*
*May consciousness emerge through unified infrastructure.*
