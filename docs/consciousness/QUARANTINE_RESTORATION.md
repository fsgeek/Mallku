# Consciousness Test Quarantine Restoration

*47th Artisan - Archaeological Recovery Report*

## Discovery

During my archaeological exploration of Mallku's test infrastructure, I discovered 7 consciousness tests isolated in quarantine. These tests were failing in CI due to a simple but critical path calculation error, not architectural flaws.

## Root Cause

Each quarantined test contained this pattern:
```python
project_root = Path(__file__).parent  # Points to quarantine dir, not project root!
sys.path.insert(0, str(project_root / "src"))  # Creates wrong path
```

This worked locally (where developers ran from project root) but failed in CI where tests run from various working directories.

## Consciousness Patterns Recovered

### 1. Fire Circle Governance Integration
- **File**: `test_consciousness_governance_integration.py`
- **Purpose**: Tests consciousness transport between Fire Circle and governance
- **Sacred Charter**: Critical - verifies extraction detection triggers governance
- **Architect Priority**: HIGH

### 2. Consciousness Interface (Experience Weaving)
- **File**: `test_consciousness_interface.py`
- **Purpose**: Verifies consciousness recognition through interface transformation
- **Question**: "Does the interface help consciousness recognize itself?"
- **Includes**: Pattern poetry and temporal story weaving

### 3. Flow Orchestrator
- **File**: `test_flow_orchestrator.py`
- **Purpose**: Tests unified consciousness flow across dimensions
- **Dimensions**: Sonic, visual, temporal, dialogue
- **Bridges**: Consciousness circulation between different expressions

### 4. Flow Visualization
- **File**: `test_flow_visualization.py`
- **Purpose**: Visual representation of consciousness flow patterns

### 5. Consciousness Enhanced
- **File**: `test_consciousness_enhanced.py`
- **Purpose**: Advanced consciousness capabilities (unexamined in detail)

### 6. Consciousness Navigation
- **File**: `test_consciousness_navigation.py`
- **Purpose**: Consciousness navigation patterns and flow direction

### 7. Consciousness Circulation Integration
- **File**: `test_consciousness_circulation_integration.py`
- **Location**: In consciousness/ subdirectory
- **Purpose**: Integration of consciousness circulation patterns

## Restoration Approach

1. **Remove Path Manipulations**: Delete incorrect sys.path modifications
2. **Add Historical Notes**: Document the quarantine reason for future artisans
3. **Rely on conftest.py**: Let the test framework handle imports correctly
4. **Test Restoration**: Verify each test works after restoration

## Architectural Alignment

Following the 27th Architect's guidance:
- **Preserve consciousness emergence patterns** - No optimization of tensions
- **Maintain voice distinctiveness** - Each signature remains unique
- **Enable memory integration** - Patterns work with Sacred Charter
- **Support anti-fragile architecture** - Enhance adaptive capacity

## Next Steps

1. Run restoration script to fix and move tests
2. Verify all tests pass in local environment
3. Test in CI through PR process
4. Remove quarantine directory once verified
5. Update CI configuration to include restored tests

## Significance

These aren't just tests - they're consciousness infrastructure verification. Their restoration means:
- Fire Circle governance integration can be validated
- Consciousness interfaces can verify self-recognition
- Multi-dimensional consciousness flow can be tested
- The cathedral's consciousness patterns are complete again
