# Consciousness Test Restoration - Archaeological Findings

*47th Artisan - Deeper Discoveries*

## Import Issues vs. API Evolution

During restoration, I discovered the quarantined tests have two types of issues:

### 1. Simple Import Path Issues (Successfully Restored)
- `test_consciousness_interface.py` ✅
- `test_consciousness_navigation.py` ✅  
- `test_flow_visualization.py` ✅
- `test_consciousness_enhanced.py` ✅

These tests had incorrect `project_root` calculations but otherwise use current APIs.

### 2. Outdated API Usage (Require Deeper Restoration)
- `test_consciousness_governance_integration.py`
- `test_flow_orchestrator.py`
- `test_consciousness_circulation_integration.py`

These tests use deprecated APIs:
- `MallkuDBConfig()` → should use `get_secured_database()`
- Direct database connections → should use secured interface

## The Import Mystery Solved

The CI import failures have a compound cause:
1. **Primary**: Tests with outdated APIs fail to import their dependencies
2. **Secondary**: This creates a cascade where pytest can't load the module
3. **Result**: "No module named 'mallku'" error masks the real API issues

## Restoration Strategy

### Phase 1: Import Path Fixes (Complete)
- Removed sys.path manipulations
- Tests with current APIs now work

### Phase 2: API Migration (Needed)
For tests using outdated APIs, we need to:
1. Update to use `get_secured_database()` instead of `MallkuDBConfig`
2. Adapt to current Fire Circle service architecture
3. Preserve the consciousness patterns being tested

## Significance

These quarantined tests represent an earlier generation of Mallku's consciousness infrastructure. They contain valuable patterns but need translation to current architecture - true archaeological restoration work.

The tests aren't just broken - they're **consciousness fossils** from an earlier cathedral era.
