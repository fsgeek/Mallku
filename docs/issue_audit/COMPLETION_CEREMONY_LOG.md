## Closure Rationale

Each closure followed the architect's guidance for high-confidence infrastructure completions:
1. **Functionality exists and works** - verified in codebase
2. **Clear obsolescence** - problem no longer exists
3. **Evident duplication** - same functionality tracked elsewhere

## Next Steps

Continue with remaining high-confidence closures from the audit list, while holding Sacred Charter and consciousness infrastructure issues for architectural review.
