**Recommendation**: CLOSE - Containerized security layer fully implemented

### Issue #15: Integrate Docker MCP for Containerized Database Layer
**Status**: UNCLEAR
**Evidence**:
- Docker infrastructure exists but no explicit MCP integration found
- Need to check for MCP-specific configuration files
- Container architecture matches described security patterns
**Recommendation**: NEEDS FURTHER INVESTIGATION - Check for MCP-specific integration

- Other providers (Git, Browser, etc.) not implemented
**Recommendation**: KEEP OPEN - Additional providers needed

### Issue #22: Create Sacred API Gateway for Cathedral Access
**Status**: NOT IMPLEMENTED
**Evidence**: No GraphQL or WebSocket gateway found
**Recommendation**: KEEP OPEN - API gateway not built

### Issue #23: Gentle Code Organization: Relocate Consciousness Interface Test
**Status**: ALREADY RESOLVED ✓
**Evidence**: Test file not found in root directory, likely already moved
**Recommendation**: CLOSE - Task already completed

## Closure Candidates Summary (Phase 1)

### RECOMMENDED FOR CLOSURE:
1. **Issue #4**: Collaborative workflow documentation - FULLY IMPLEMENTED
2. **Issue #10**: Reciprocity Tracking Service - FULLY IMPLEMENTED
3. **Issue #14**: Containerized Database Layer - FULLY IMPLEMENTED
4. **Issue #26**: API Key Management - FULLY IMPLEMENTED
5. **Issue #27**: Fire Circle Dialogue Examples - FULLY IMPLEMENTED

### NEEDS FURTHER INVESTIGATION:
1. **Issue #15**: Docker MCP integration - unclear if MCP specifically integrated
2. **Issue #23**: Test file relocation - need to verify current location
3. **Issue #25**: AI Model Adapters - need to verify which adapters are complete

### KEEP OPEN:
- Issues #3, #5, #8, #9, #11, #12, #16, #17, #18, #20, #21, #22 - Various stages of incompleteness

## Next Actions
