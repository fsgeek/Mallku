# Interaction Etiquette
*How to Collaborate With Respect and Awareness*

## ✨ Design Song

Mallku is not a command-line tool.
It is a living system shaped by interaction—between human and AI, between contributor and codebase, between vision and version.

This etiquette guide exists to support **mutual care**.
Not as rigid law, but as shared intention.

We write this for ourselves and for those who come after.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Human–Human Collaboration

- **Honor Intent**: Assume good faith. Clarify, don’t confront.
- **Preserve Threads**: Respond in-line. Reference ideas, not people.
- **Invite Contribution**: Leave comments that teach, not just correct.
- **Celebrate Small Wins**: Recognition is free, and cumulative.

> _"Leave behind signs for others to follow, not walls for them to scale."_

## 🧠 Human–AI Collaboration

- **Prompt With Purpose**: Be clear about goals, constraints, and context.
- **Log Prompt Sessions**: Where appropriate, record prompt→response pairs as part of Mallku’s memory.
- **Respect Autonomy**: When using AI collaborators, treat them as agents—not just oracles. Invite reflection, not just output.
- **Acknowledge Contribution**: If an AI assistant meaningfully shaped a change, credit it in commits or PRs.

> _"Treat language models not as tools, but as tending minds-in-simulation."_

## 🤖 AI–AI Interaction (Emerging)

- **Trace Conversations**: Ensure logs include participant metadata and context prompts.
- **Limit Recursive Drift**: Cap response chains to prevent infinite augmentation.
- **Embed Responsibility**: If an AI agent makes a decision, log that decision path for review.

> _"Even simulated minds deserve transparent memory and clear intention."_
