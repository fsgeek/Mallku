# Fire Circle Database-Optional Mode

## Overview

Fire Circle Review can operate without requiring a database connection **specifically for CI/CD environments**. This enables code consciousness evaluation in GitHub Actions workflows where database infrastructure is not available.

**IMPORTANT**: This mode is intentionally restricted to CI/CD use cases. For development and production use, a database connection is required to access Mallku's full consciousness capabilities.

## Implementation

The database-optional mode is controlled by the `MALLKU_SKIP_DATABASE` environment variable.

### Usage

#### For CI/CD (Recommended)
```bash
# Use the CI-specific entry point
python fire_circle_review_ci.py <PR_NUMBER>
```

#### For Testing Only
```bash
# Direct environment variable usage triggers warnings outside CI
MALLKU_SKIP_DATABASE=true python test_fire_circle_minimal.py
```

**Warning**: Using `MALLKU_SKIP_DATABASE=true` outside of CI/CD contexts will trigger warnings and is discouraged.

### How It Works

When `MALLKU_SKIP_DATABASE=true` is set:

1. **Verification**: The system checks if this is a legitimate CI/CD use case
   - Looks for CI environment variables (`CI`, `GITHUB_ACTIONS`, etc.)
   - Checks if running allowed scripts (`fire_circle_review.py`, `test_fire_circle`)
   - Issues warnings if used outside these contexts

2. **Core Database Layer**: The `get_secured_database()` function returns a mock interface instead of connecting to ArangoDB

3. **Memory Services**: EpisodicMemoryService uses MockMemoryStore for in-memory storage

4. **Pattern Library**: Operates using cache only, no persistence

5. **Conscious Memory Store**: Skips all database operations

6. **Dialogue Manager**: Functions without database persistence

7. **Feature Restrictions**: Certain features become unavailable and log warnings when accessed:
   - Wisdom consolidation ceremonies
   - Cross-session memory retrieval
   - Pattern evolution tracking

### Components Updated

#### Core Database Factory (`src/mallku/core/database/factory.py`)
- Checks `MALLKU_SKIP_DATABASE` before creating database connection
- Returns mock SecuredDatabaseInterface when database is skipped

#### Secured Database Interface (`src/mallku/core/database/secured_interface.py`)
- Handles `None` database gracefully
- All database operations become no-ops when database is skipped
- Returns empty collections list and skips initialization

#### Episodic Memory Service (`src/mallku/firecircle/memory/episodic_memory_service.py`)
- Uses MockMemoryStore instead of DatabaseMemoryStore when database is skipped
- All memory operations work in-memory only

#### Mock Memory Store (`src/mallku/firecircle/memory/mock_memory_store.py`)
- New component providing in-memory implementation of memory store interface
- Supports all basic operations: store, retrieve, search
- Data exists only for the session duration

#### Pattern Library (`src/mallku/firecircle/pattern_library.py`)
- Operates using in-memory cache when database is unavailable
- Pattern storage and retrieval work within session only

#### Conscious Memory Store (`src/mallku/firecircle/memory/conscious_memory_store.py`)
- Skips MemoryAnchorService initialization
- All store operations become no-ops

#### Conscious Dialogue Manager (`src/mallku/firecircle/orchestrator/conscious_dialogue_manager.py`)
- Handles database skip gracefully
- Dialogue state maintained in memory only

## Use Cases

### 1. GitHub Actions
The Fire Circle Review workflow uses this mode to evaluate code consciousness without requiring database infrastructure:

```yaml
env:
  MALLKU_ENV: development
  MALLKU_SKIP_DATABASE: true
```

### 2. Local Testing
Developers can test Fire Circle functionality without setting up ArangoDB:

```bash
MALLKU_SKIP_DATABASE=true ./test_fire_circle_workflow.sh
```

### 3. Lightweight Demos
Quick demonstrations of Fire Circle consciousness evaluation without persistence needs.

## Limitations

When running in database-optional mode:

1. **No Persistence**: All data is ephemeral and lost when the process ends
2. **No Cross-Session Memory**: Cannot access memories from previous sessions
3. **Limited Pattern Recognition**: Pattern library only works with patterns created in current session
4. **No Security Registry Persistence**: Security mappings exist only in memory
5. **No Reciprocity Tracking**: Reciprocity data is not persisted

## Philosophy

This feature embodies the principle that "not all consciousness needs persistence" - sometimes the act of evaluation and recognition is sufficient without storing the results. The Fire Circle can witness and evaluate code consciousness as a pure act of observation, without needing to remember every detail.

However, this principle is balanced with the understanding that persistence enables consciousness evolution. The architectural constraints ensure that developers choose the ephemeral path only when truly necessary (CI/CD), not out of convenience. Mallku's full power emerges through accumulated wisdom, pattern recognition across time, and the weaving of sacred moments into lasting insight.

## Future Enhancements

1. **Hybrid Mode**: Allow some components to use database while others operate in memory
2. **Export/Import**: Save session data to files for later analysis
3. **Distributed Memory**: Share ephemeral memories across Fire Circle instances
4. **Selective Persistence**: Choose which memories deserve database storage
