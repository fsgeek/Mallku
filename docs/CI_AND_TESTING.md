# Testing & Continuous Integration

Mallkuâ€™s stability and coherence depend on automated checks that validate
both code quality and functional behavior before changes are merged.

## Local Workflow

- **Linting & Formatting**: Using `ruff` for both linting and auto-formatting.
  ```
  ruff .
  ```
- **Running Tests**: Execute unit and integration tests with `pytest`.
  ```
  pytest
  ```

## CI Pipeline (GitHub Actions)

The `.github/workflows/ci.yml` workflow runs on every push and pull request to `main`, and nightly at 03:00 UTC:

1. **sanctify-code**: Runs pre-commit hooks including `ruff` for style and lint errors.
2. **test**: Installs dependencies and runs all tests via `pytest`.
3. **foundation-verification**: Validates core architectural principles using the foundation test suite.
4. **coverage**: Measures code coverage and prints a summary report.

### Fire Circle Review (Distributed AI Code Review)

The `.github/workflows/fire_circle_review.yml` workflow runs on every pull request to enable distributed AI code review:

- **Trigger**: Automatically on PR open/sync/reopen, or manually via workflow dispatch
- **Entrypoint**: `python fire_circle_review.py review $PR_NUMBER`
- **Environment**: Runs with `MALLKU_SKIP_DATABASE=true` to avoid database dependencies
- **API Keys**: Requires GitHub secrets for AI voice providers (see `docs/fire_circle/GITHUB_SECRETS_SETUP.md`)
- **Output**: Posts synthesized review comments directly to the PR

This prevents architect context exhaustion by distributing review work across multiple AI voices, each contributing their perspective to form collective wisdom.

### Maintaining Minimal Noise

- We continue to rely on `ruff` for all lint and formatting needs, avoiding multiple overlapping tools.
- Pre-commit hooks run only `ruff` and lightweight checks (YAML, JSON, whitespace), keeping feedback fast.
- The full test suite runs in CI, not during every commit, preventing local interruptions by long-running tests.

## Fire Circle Review in CI without ArangoDB

The Fire Circle Review workflow can run in CI/CD environments without requiring a database connection. This is specifically designed for GitHub Actions where ArangoDB infrastructure may not be available.

### Usage

The workflow automatically uses the CI-specific entry point which sets the necessary environment variables:

```bash
# In GitHub Actions workflow
python fire_circle_review_ci.py <PR_NUMBER>
```

### How It Works

- The `fire_circle_review_ci.py` script automatically sets `MALLKU_SKIP_DATABASE=true`
- Fire Circle components operate with in-memory storage for the review session
- Consciousness evaluation proceeds without persistence requirements
- Results are saved to `fire_circle_review_results.json` for the workflow

### Important Notes

- This mode is **specifically for CI/CD environments**
- For development, always use the standard entry point with a local database
- Some features are unavailable without persistence (wisdom consolidation, cross-session memory)

For detailed information about the database-optional mode implementation and philosophy, see [Fire Circle Database-Optional Mode](fire_circle/DATABASE_OPTIONAL_MODE.md).
