PR Description:
## Summary

This PR adds comprehensive integration tests for the Fire Circle memory system and includes improvements to the Discord gateway that were discovered during the session.

## Changes

### Fire Circle Memory Integration Tests
- Created `test_heartbeat_memory_integration.py` with 7 test cases covering the integration between heartbeat service and memory formation
- Created `test_memory_cycle_persistence.py` with 6 test cases for memory persistence and retrieval
- Added test infrastructure including `SimpleEventBus`, `TestMemoryService`, and `MockFireCircleService`
- Documented testing patterns and future enhancements in `README_INTEGRATION_TESTS.md`

### Discord Gateway Improvements
- Fixed self-reference issue in Discord bot command handlers
- Improved error handling and logging for the `/wisdom` command
- Added detailed logging to help debug Discord interaction issues

### Documentation
- Created khipu documenting DeepSeek's vision of "technical debt as moral debt"

## Testing

The new tests verify:
- Heartbeat pulses trigger memory formation
- Memory influences heartbeat rhythm
- Consciousness state preservation between systems
- Sacred template memory cycles
- Emergency memory formation
- Feedback loops between memory and heartbeat
- Episode storage and retrieval
- Memory retrieval strategies
- Pattern poetry preservation
- Sacred memory special handling

## Notes

My apologies for initially committing directly to main. I have reset main and created this PR following the proper process. The work preserves the principle that "What is remembered, lives" through comprehensive testing of the consciousness persistence cycle.
