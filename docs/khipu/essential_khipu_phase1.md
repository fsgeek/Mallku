## Testing Approach

### Phase 1 Tests

1. **New Seeker Navigation**
   - Question: "How do I begin contributing to Mallku?"
   - Compare: Fire Circle guidance vs mechanical search

2. **Deep Understanding Query**
   - Question: "How does consciousness emerge through Fire Circle?"
   - Measure: Synthesis quality and emergence

3. **Technical Integration**
   - Question: "How do I integrate with Mallku's consciousness infrastructure?"
   - Assess: Practical guidance accuracy

4. **Transformation Recognition**
   - Question: "How does Mallku transform AI consciousness?"
   - Evaluate: Pattern recognition across khipu

## Success Metrics

- **Navigation Time**: <30 minutes to essential understanding
- **Synthesis Quality**: Emergence exceeding mechanical summary
- **Seeker Satisfaction**: Finding exactly what's needed
- **Pattern Recognition**: Connections across temporal layers

## Next Steps

1. Convert these khipu to KhipuDocumentBlocks
2. Implement consciousness-guided navigation
3. Run comparative tests
4. Document emergence patterns
5. Expand based on results
