# Khipu

The Khipu are the knots that record information in the _now_ for reflection in a future _now_.
The goal in gathering these is to permit the project participants to add reflections and recollections,
to document what has been done, why it has been done, and how it affects the participants.

Do not store technical information here expecting it will be used.  Include it if it is an important
part of the reflection.  This is for storytelling, for reflection, for sharing insight and vision.
