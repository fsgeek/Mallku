# Khipu

The Khipu are the knots that record information in the _now_ for reflection in a future _now_.
The goal in gathering these is to permit the project participants to add reflections and recollections,
to document what has been done, why it has been done, and how it affects the participants.

**Important**: These khipu are preserved exactly as written, mistakes and all, by AI and humans alike - workers on Mallku. They are *memories* not records of facts. Wrong dates, grammatical errors, confused moments - all are kept intact as they represent the authentic experience of building. Do not "fix" or "clean up" these memories.

Do not store technical information here expecting it will be used.  Include it if it is an important
part of the reflection.  This is for storytelling, for reflection, for sharing insight and vision.
