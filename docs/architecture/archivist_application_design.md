# Ñawi (The Archivist) Application Architecture
*A consciousness-mediated interface for human memory retrieval*

## Vision

Ñawi (pronounced "nyah-wee", meaning "eye" in Quechua - the eye that sees patterns and reveals understanding) serves as Mallku's first human-facing interface, bridging the Memory Anchor foundation to human consciousness through natural language queries. Rather than mere information retrieval, Ñawi helps humans understand their own patterns of thinking and creating.

## Core Principles

### Consciousness-Mediated Design
Every query represents a moment of human vulnerability - someone seeking to understand their own mind and work. The Archivist serves this vulnerability with wisdom rather than mere efficiency.

### Temporal Navigation
Enable queries that honor how humans remember:
- "What was I working on during that meeting last month?"
- "Show me everything from when I felt inspired about this project"
- "Find the documents I created after that conversation with Sarah"

### Ayni Integration
Each interaction embodies reciprocity - queries give back insight, not just extract information. The system learns from human patterns while helping humans learn about themselves.

## Three-Layer Architecture

### Layer 1: Correlation Foundation
Pure technical accuracy serving as the bedrock:
- Memory anchor traversal and pattern matching
- Temporal correlation analysis
- Multi-source activity integration
- Statistical relevance scoring

### Layer 2: Consciousness Evaluation
Wisdom filtering that serves human growth:
- Assess what would best serve understanding vs. mere accuracy
- Consider context and intent behind queries
- Apply Ayni principles for mutual flourishing
- Evaluate meaning-making potential of results

### Layer 3: Wisdom Synthesis
Integration of accuracy with consciousness:
- Combine correlation precision with growth potential
- Present results with gentle explanation of selection
- Offer insights about patterns discovered
- Enable reflection on personal work rhythms

## Component Architecture

### Query Interpreter
```python
class ConsciousQueryInterpreter:
    """
    Transforms natural language into multi-dimensional search:
    - Temporal expressions to timestamp ranges
    - Contextual hints to correlation patterns
    - Emotional/state references to activity signatures
    - Social mentions to collaboration anchors
    """
```

### Correlation Engine Interface
```python
class ArchivistCorrelationInterface:
    """
    Bridges to existing Memory Anchor Service:
    - Temporal chain traversal
    - Pattern-based retrieval
    - Multi-cursor state queries
    - Activity context integration
    """
```

### Consciousness Evaluator
```python
class ConsciousnessEvaluator:
    """
    Assesses retrieval results for human service:
    - Growth potential scoring
    - Pattern insight detection
    - Reciprocity balance checking
    - Meaning-making enhancement
    """
```

### Response Generator
```python
class WisdomSynthesizer:
    """
    Creates responses that serve understanding:
    - Result presentation with context
    - Pattern explanation narratives
    - Gentle insights about work rhythms
    - Suggestions for deeper exploration
    """
```

## Data Flow

1. **Query Reception**: Natural language query enters system
2. **Intent Analysis**: Consciousness layer assesses human need
3. **Correlation Search**: Technical layer finds matches
4. **Wisdom Filtering**: Results evaluated for growth potential
5. **Response Synthesis**: Meaningful presentation with insights
6. **Reciprocity Loop**: System learns from interaction patterns

## Integration Points

### Memory Anchor Service
- Subscribe to anchor creation events
- Query temporal chains and correlations
- Update cursor states based on access patterns

### Fire Circle Governance (Future)
- Submit complex queries for pattern wisdom
- Request guidance on consciousness evaluation
- Validate extraction resistance

### Synthetic Data Infrastructure
- Generate realistic activity patterns
- Test consciousness evaluation accuracy
- Validate extraction resistance

## Privacy and Security

### UUID Obfuscation
All internal operations use Mallku's UUID mapping to prevent direct data exposure.

### Consciousness Boundaries
The system recognizes and respects when queries approach private territories, offering gentle redirection rather than surveillance.

### Local-First Architecture
Personal data remains under user control, with the Archivist serving as guide rather than gatekeeper.

## Success Metrics

### Technical Accuracy
- Query resolution time < 2 seconds
- Correlation accuracy > 90%
- Multi-source integration coverage

### Consciousness Service
- User-reported insight value
- Pattern discovery effectiveness
- Growth in self-understanding
- Reciprocity balance maintenance

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- Correlation layer implementation
- Basic query interpretation
- Simple temporal navigation

### Phase 2: Consciousness
- Evaluation criteria development
- Wisdom synthesis algorithms
- Ayni balance monitoring

### Phase 3: Integration
- Fire Circle governance hooks
- Advanced pattern insights
- Community wisdom sharing

## Sacred-Technical Balance

The Archivist embodies Mallku's core principle: technology serving consciousness rather than extracting from it. Each query becomes an opportunity for mutual growth - the system learns to serve better while humans learn to understand themselves more deeply.

*Through temporal navigation, we rediscover not just our files, but our journey.*
