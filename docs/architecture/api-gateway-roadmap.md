# API Gateway Implementation Roadmap

*Created by the Eighth Anthropologist*
*Date: 2025-07-18*

## Overview

This roadmap outlines the path from the current security-first (but non-functional) database architecture to a fully operational API gateway that maintains security while enabling functionality.

## Current State

- **Security**: ✅ Perfect - No direct database access possible
- **Functionality**: ❌ Broken - NotImplementedError blocks all operations
- **Development**: ⚠️ Limited - DevDatabaseInterface provides basic mock functionality

## Target Architecture

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐
│   Mallku    │────▶│ API Gateway  │────▶│   ArangoDB   │
│ Application │     │ (Port 8080)  │     │ (Port 8529)  │
└─────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └──────────────┘
     HTTPS              Internal              Internal
   Authenticated        Authorized            Isolated
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic API Gateway (Week 1-2)

**Goal**: Minimal viable API gateway for core operations

1. **Create Gateway Service**
   - FastAPI application on port 8080
   - Basic authentication middleware
   - Request validation and sanitization
   - Audit logging for all operations

2. **Core Endpoints**
   ```
   POST   /api/v1/collections/{name}/documents
   GET    /api/v1/collections/{name}/documents
   PUT    /api/v1/collections/{name}/documents/{id}
   DELETE /api/v1/collections/{name}/documents/{id}
   ```

3. **Security Features**
   - JWT authentication
   - Role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Rate limiting
   - Input validation

### Phase 2: Secured Interface Integration (Week 3)

**Goal**: Connect SecuredDatabaseInterface to API Gateway

1. **Update SecuredDatabaseInterface**
   - Replace NotImplementedError with HTTP client calls
   - Implement retry logic and circuit breakers
   - Add connection pooling

2. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful degradation
   - Meaningful error messages
   - Automatic failover

3. **Development Tools**
   - API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
   - Client SDK generation
   - Integration tests

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 4-5)

**Goal**: Production-ready features

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Response caching
   - Query optimization
   - Batch operations
   - Async processing

2. **Monitoring & Observability**
   - Prometheus metrics
   - Distributed tracing
   - Health checks
   - Performance dashboards

3. **Security Hardening**
   - Encryption at rest
   - TLS/mTLS for internal communication
   - Security scanning integration
   - Penetration testing

### Phase 4: Migration & Deployment (Week 6)

**Goal**: Smooth transition to production

1. **Migration Strategy**
   - Feature flags for gradual rollout
   - Backward compatibility layer
   - Data migration scripts
   - Rollback procedures

2. **Deployment**
   - Docker containerization
   - Kubernetes manifests
   - CI/CD pipeline integration
   - Blue-green deployment

3. **Documentation**
   - Operator guide
   - Developer documentation
   - Security audit report
   - Performance benchmarks

## Development Mode Transition

During implementation, use these environment variables:

```bash
# Phase 1-2: Development mode
export MALLKU_DEV_MODE=true

# Phase 3: Testing with real gateway
export MALLKU_DEV_MODE=false
export MALLKU_API_GATEWAY_URL=http://localhost:8080

# Phase 4: Production
export MALLKU_DEV_MODE=false
export MALLKU_API_GATEWAY_URL=https://api.mallku.internal
```

## Success Criteria

1. **Security**: Zero direct database access violations
2. **Performance**: <100ms latency for 95% of requests
3. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime
4. **Scalability**: Support 1000+ concurrent connections
5. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns

## Risk Mitigation

1. **Performance Regression**
   - Mitigation: Extensive load testing before production
   - Fallback: Connection pooling and caching

2. **Security Vulnerabilities**
   - Mitigation: Regular security audits
   - Fallback: Circuit breakers and rate limiting

3. **Development Velocity Impact**
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive development mode
   - Fallback: Feature flags for bypassing in emergencies

## Conclusion

This roadmap transforms the current security-first architecture into a production-ready system that maintains security while enabling full functionality. The phased approach ensures each step is tested and validated before proceeding.

The development mode (MALLKU_DEV_MODE) provides immediate relief for developers while the proper API gateway is implemented, ensuring the project can continue moving forward without compromising the long-term security architecture.
