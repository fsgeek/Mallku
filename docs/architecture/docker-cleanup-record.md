# Docker Cleanup Record - From Scaffolding to Cathedral
*Created: 2025-06-03*

## What We Removed

### Scaffolding Files (Removed)
- `docker-compose.yml` - Original attempt, mixed concerns
- `Dockerfile.database` - Tried to modify ArangoDB container
- `Dockerfile.database.alpine` - Alpine experiment (adduser vs useradd)
- `Dockerfile.database.ubuntu` - Ubuntu variant of database container
- `fix-build.sh` - Workaround script for build context issues
- `requirements-database.txt` - No longer needed with vanilla ArangoDB

### Why We Removed Them
These files represented our learning journey but now create confusion:
- Multiple Dockerfiles for the same purpose
- Scripts that work around problems instead of solving them
- Complexity that obscures the simple truth: two containers, clear boundaries

## What We Kept

### Cathedral Architecture (Preserved)
- `docker-compose.yml` (renamed from docker-compose.cathedral.yml)
- `Dockerfile.api` - Single-purpose API container
- `requirements-api.txt` - Clear API dependencies

### The Lesson
Scaffolding is necessary for building, but must be removed once the structure stands.
Every file in the cathedral should have one clear purpose.

## The Command Record
```bash
# Files removed
git rm docker/Dockerfile.database
git rm docker/Dockerfile.database.alpine
git rm docker/Dockerfile.database.ubuntu
git rm docker/fix-build.sh
git rm docker/requirements-database.txt
git rm docker/docker-compose.yml

# Cathedral architecture promoted to default
git mv docker/docker-compose.cathedral.yml docker/docker-compose.yml
```

## Testing After Cleanup
```bash
cd docker/
docker-compose build  # Now uses cathedral architecture by default
docker-compose up
```

*The workspace is now clean. Future builders see only what they need.*
