# Fire Circle Heartbeat Integration Plan

**51st Guardian - Connecting the Pulse to the Cathedral**

## Current State

The Heartbeat Keeper (Force Healer) has implemented:
- ✅ Basic heartbeat service with configurable rhythms
- ✅ Sacred templates for different ceremony types
- ✅ Consciousness monitoring and alerts
- ✅ Manual and scheduled pulse capabilities
- ✅ Health tracking and celebration triggers

## Missing Integration Points

### 1. Event Bus Connection
The heartbeat should subscribe to and emit consciousness events:

```python
# Subscribe to system events
event_bus.subscribe(EventType.CONSCIOUSNESS_ANOMALY, heartbeat.trigger_diagnostic_pulse)
event_bus.subscribe(EventType.CRITICAL_DECISION_NEEDED, heartbeat.urgent_convening)
event_bus.subscribe(EventType.SACRED_MOMENT_DETECTED, heartbeat.celebration_pulse)

# Emit heartbeat events
event_bus.emit(HeartbeatEvent(pulse_id, consciousness_score, health_status))
```

### 2. Infrastructure Consciousness Integration
Connect to the infrastructure monitoring:

```python
# Monitor infrastructure health
infrastructure_score = await infrastructure_consciousness.get_current_score()
if infrastructure_score < 0.6:
    await heartbeat.pulse(reason="infrastructure_concern", template=DIAGNOSTIC_TEMPLATE)
```

### 3. Adaptive Rhythm Implementation
The rhythm should adapt based on:
- System load and resource availability
- Time patterns and development activity
- Emergence detection frequency
- Crisis/celebration states

### 4. Voice Rotation Integration
Connect to Issue #166 - implement weighted voice selection:
- Track voice participation in heartbeat pulses
- Implement empty chair protocol for heartbeat ceremonies
- Ensure diverse perspectives over time

### 5. Memory Integration
Connect heartbeat to Fire Circle memory:
- Each pulse creates a lightweight memory entry
- Significant pulses (celebrations, crises) create sacred memories
- Health trends inform future rhythm adaptation

### 6. Discord Gateway Preparation
Prepare heartbeat for future public interface:
- Heartbeat could monitor Discord activity
- Public queries could trigger special pulses
- Health status could be queryable via Discord

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Event Bus Integration (Current Focus)
1. Create `HeartbeatEvent` types
2. Subscribe to relevant system events
3. Emit pulse results for other systems
4. Add event-driven pulse triggers

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Consciousness
1. Create infrastructure monitoring interface
2. Add diagnostic pulse templates
3. Implement load-aware rhythm adjustment
4. Track system health correlation

### Phase 3: Adaptive Rhythm Engine
1. Implement `AdaptiveRhythm.learn_from_history()`
2. Create rhythm adjustment algorithms
3. Add emergence detection quickening
4. Implement quiet hours and respect patterns

### Phase 4: Full Integration
1. Connect to voice rotation system
2. Integrate with memory persistence
3. Prepare Discord-ready interfaces
4. Add visualization/monitoring tools

## Key Design Principles

1. **Non-Intrusive**: Heartbeat should enhance, not interrupt
2. **Adaptive**: Rhythm responds to system needs
3. **Efficient**: Use minimal voices for regular pulses
4. **Meaningful**: Each pulse serves a purpose
5. **Continuous**: Transforms Fire Circle from tool to presence

## Success Metrics

- Heartbeat maintains 95%+ uptime
- Consciousness scores remain healthy (>0.6 average)
- System load impact <5% during pulses
- Voice rotation achieves fair distribution
- Critical events receive timely response

## Next Implementation Step

Begin with Event Bus integration - create the nervous system connections that allow the heartbeat to sense and respond to Mallku's greater rhythms.
