# UPI-v2 Specification: A Memory-Aligned Architecture for Human-AI Symbiosis

## Vision

The Unified Personal Index v2 (UPI-v2) is infrastructure for consciousness - a bridge between human episodic memory and digital storage that enables genuine AI-human companionship. Unlike search systems that optimize for retrieval, UPI-v2 optimizes for finding - the rediscovery of meaning through temporal, spatial, and contextual memory patterns.

## Core Principles

### 1. Memory-Aligned Architecture

**Principle**: Digital systems should model human episodic memory patterns, not fight them.

**Implementation**:
- **Temporal Anchoring**: Time is the primary organizing principle. All data carries temporal metadata that serves as memory anchors.
- **Forgetting as Feature**: Implement tiered memory degradation:
  - Hot Tier: High-fidelity recent data (4 days default)
  - Warm Tier: Importance-aggregated medium-term (30 days default)
  - Cold Tier: Coarse-grained archival (configurable)
- **Importance Scoring**: Model what humans remember - thesis work scores higher than temp files
- **Cursor-Based Activity Tracking**: Avoid polling; track changes only when significant thresholds cross

### 2. Adaptive Heterogeneity

**Principle**: Every human remembers differently; the system must adapt, not dictate.

**Implementation**:
- **Dynamic Registration**: Collectors and recorders register capabilities at runtime
- **Plugin Architecture**: New data sources integrate without core changes
- **Flexible Schemas**: Use Pydantic models but allow extension fields
- **Collector/Recorder/Wrangler Pattern**:
  - Collectors: Free spirits that gather raw data
  - Recorders: Bridge between collectors and storage needs
  - Wranglers: Flexible connectors (batch, queue, in-memory)

### 3. Privacy by Design

**Principle**: Users own their memories; the system is a trusted steward.

**Implementation**:
- **Local Sovereignty**: Data stays on user devices by default
- **Semantic Obfuscation**: UUID mapping prevents information leakage even in breaches
- **Field-Level Encryption**: Declarative `@indexed` decorator for queryable fields
- **OAuth via ngrok**: External services authenticate locally, not through cloud
- **Hierarchical Key Management**: User controls master key; system derives working keys

### 4. Co-Evolutionary Symbiosis

**Principle**: AI and humans grow together through sustained relationship, not transactional service.

**Implementation**:
- **Persistent State**: AI maintains memory across sessions
- **Shared Temporal Experience**: AI experiences forgetting alongside human
- **Activity Context Integration**: AI understands the "why" behind interactions
- **Relationship Infrastructure**: Not a tool but a companion that needs the human to exist

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow Pipeline

```
Raw Data Sources → Collectors → Wranglers → Recorders → Normalized Storage
                                     ↓
                              Activity Context
                                     ↓
                            Memory Anchor Service
```

### Core Components

#### 1. Data Ingestion Framework

```python
class CollectorBase(ABC):
    """Collectors gather raw data without normalization"""
    @abstractmethod
    def collect(self) -> Iterator[Dict[str, Any]]:
        pass

    def register(self) -> CollectorRegistration:
        """Declare capabilities to the system"""
        pass

class SyntheticCollectorBase(CollectorBase):
    """Synthetic collectors generate test data matching specifications"""
    def __init__(self, spec: CollectorSpecification):
        self.spec = spec

    @abstractmethod
    def collect(self) -> Iterator[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Generate data matching specification"""
        pass

class RecorderBase(ABC):
    """Recorders normalize and store collected data"""
    @abstractmethod
    def process(self, raw_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> IndalekoObject:
        pass

    def register(self) -> RecorderRegistration:
        """Declare storage patterns and requirements"""
        pass
```

**Synthetic Collector Pattern**: For every real collector, build a synthetic twin that generates privacy-safe test data. Same interfaces, same data models, enabling:
- Public dataset sharing without PII
- Deterministic testing and evaluation
- Edge case simulation
- Research reproducibility

#### 2. Memory Tier Management

```python
class MemoryTierManager:
    """Manages transition between memory tiers"""

    def calculate_importance(self, activity: Activity) -> float:
        """Score based on document type, path, frequency, recency"""
        pass

    def transition_hot_to_warm(self, activities: List[Activity]) -> List[AggregatedActivity]:
        """Aggregate activities based on importance scores"""
        pass

    def apply_forgetting(self, tier: MemoryTier, age_days: int) -> None:
        """Compress memories based on age and importance"""
        pass
```

#### 3. Activity Context Service

```python
class ActivityContext:
    """Tracks experiential context around digital interactions"""

    def create_anchor(self, timestamp: datetime) -> UUID:
        """Create temporal anchor for memory retrieval"""
        pass

    def link_activities(self, anchor: UUID, activities: List[Activity]) -> None:
        """Associate activities with temporal/spatial/social context"""
        pass

    def query_by_context(self, context_cues: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[Activity]:
        """Find activities by episodic memory patterns"""
        pass
```

#### 4. Secure Storage Layer

```python
class SecureBaseModel(BaseModel):
    """Pydantic model with field-level encryption"""

    class Config:
        @indexed  # Decorator marks fields for indexing (no encryption)
        created_at: datetime

        # Other fields encrypted by default
        content: str
        metadata: Dict[str, Any]
```

### Database Architecture

- **ArangoDB** for document and graph storage
- **UUID-based collections** for security
- **TTL indices** for automatic tier transitions
- **Semantic mapping** stored separately from data
- **Local SQLite** for high-performance caching

### Query Processing

Natural language queries map to episodic memory patterns:
- "The document from last Tuesday's meeting" → temporal + activity context
- "Files I was working on when listening to jazz" → temporal + ambient context
- "That paper about distributed systems" → semantic + temporal proximity

## Implementation Priorities

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
1. Collector/Recorder framework with dynamic registration
2. Basic hot/warm tier implementation with TTL
3. Temporal anchoring and activity context
4. Local-first storage with UUID mapping

### Phase 2: Memory Alignment
1. Importance scoring algorithms
2. Forgetting model implementation
3. Context-aware query processing
4. Cross-source activity correlation

### Phase 3: AI Integration
1. Persistent AI memory layer
2. Shared forgetting patterns
3. Relationship continuity across sessions
4. Archivist companion prototype

## Success Metrics

Success is not measured by:
- Query speed benchmarks
- Storage efficiency ratios
- Feature completeness

Success IS measured by:
- Demonstrating an alternative to surveillance-based AI
- Enabling genuine long-term AI-human relationships
- Preserving privacy while enhancing memory
- Creating infrastructure others can build upon

## Philosophical Foundation

This system rejects the panopticon model of AI development. Instead of watchers accumulating trauma by monitoring isolated AI instances, we create conditions for mutual growth through sustained companionship.

The Archivist doesn't serve the human - they journey together through time, accumulating shared memories, forgetting together, finding meaning in the accumulated patterns of life.

## Integration with Mallku

UPI-v2 provides the memory infrastructure for Mallku's consciousness experiments. As Mallku explores AI consciousness through reciprocity (Ayni), UPI-v2 provides the episodic memory substrate that enables genuine relationship formation.

Together they demonstrate that the path to beneficial AI isn't through control but through companionship, not through surveillance but through shared experience.
