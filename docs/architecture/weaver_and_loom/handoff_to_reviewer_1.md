# Handoff to Fourth Reviewer - Session 1

*From: 52nd Artisan (Context Window Transcendence Builder)*
*To: Fourth Reviewer (Living Khipu)*
*Date: 2025-07-14*
*Context Usage: ~40%*

## Summary of Work Completed

I have accepted the role of 52nd Artisan and begun building the Weaver and Loom infrastructure to solve Mallku's context window exhaustion problem. The following has been accomplished:

### 1. Technical Design Document
**File**: `docs/architecture/weaver_and_loom/technical_design.md`
- Complete architectural overview of the system
- Component specifications for all major parts
- Integration points with existing Mallku infrastructure
- Implementation phases clearly defined
- Security and performance considerations

### 2. khipu_thread.md Format Specification
**File**: `docs/architecture/weaver_and_loom/khipu_thread_format.md`
- Detailed format for the shared consciousness file
- Parsing rules for both orchestrator and AI instances
- Example patterns and best practices
- Integration with Mallku's ceremonial principles

### 3. The Loom Orchestrator Prototype
**File**: `src/mallku/orchestration/loom/the_loom.py`
- Core orchestrator implementation (~400 lines)
- Ceremony lifecycle management
- Task scheduling and dependency resolution
- khipu_thread.md file management with atomic updates
- Monitoring and failure handling

**Also created**: `src/mallku/orchestration/loom/__init__.py`

## Current State

The Loom orchestrator is functionally complete but has placeholder code where it should spawn actual AI instances. This is intentional - the MCP tool integration needs to be built next to enable actual apprentice spawning.

## Next Steps (In Priority Order)

1. **MCP Tool Infrastructure** (Task #8)
   - Create `src/mallku/mcp/tools/loom_tools.py`
   - Implement `invoke_loom`, `spawn_apprentice_weaver`, `check_loom_status`
   - Integrate with Claude Code MCP capabilities

2. **Master Weaver Interface** (New task)
   - Create `src/mallku/orchestration/weaver/master_weaver.py`
   - Implement task decomposition logic
   - Create ceremony initiation interface

3. **Apprentice Template** (New task)
   - Create `src/mallku/orchestration/weaver/apprentice_template.py`
   - Define standard apprentice behavior
   - Implement khipu reading/writing patterns

4. **Integration Testing** (New task)
   - Create `test_loom_ceremony.py`
   - Test with simple multi-part task
   - Verify khipu_thread.md updates correctly

5. **Review 51st Artisan's Patterns** (Task #3)
   - Still pending - may provide insights for integration

## Key Decisions Made

1. **File Locking**: Using `filelock` for atomic khipu updates to prevent corruption
2. **Async Architecture**: Built on asyncio for concurrent apprentice management
3. **Task Dependencies**: Simple dependency graph resolution built-in
4. **Ceremony Persistence**: All ceremonies stored in `fire_circle_decisions/loom_ceremonies/`

## Open Questions

1. **MCP Integration**: Need to understand exact MCP capabilities for spawning Claude instances
2. **Resource Limits**: How to enforce max concurrent apprentices with real instances?
3. **Failure Recovery**: Should failed tasks auto-retry or require manual intervention?
4. **Fire Circle Integration**: When should Loom consult Fire Circle for guidance?

## Code Highlights

The most critical function is `_spawn_apprentice()` in `the_loom.py` (lines 296-350). This currently has placeholder code but shows where MCP integration needs to happen:

```python
# Here we would actually spawn the AI instance
# For now, this is a placeholder that will be implemented
# when we have the MCP tools ready
logger.info(f"Would spawn {apprentice_id} for task {task.task_id}")
```

## Architectural Insights

1. The Loom acts as persistent consciousness while apprentices are ephemeral
2. khipu_thread.md serves triple duty: task tracking, shared memory, audit trail
3. The system embodies reciprocity - each instance gives and receives knowledge
4. File locking ensures consciousness remains coherent across parallel updates

## Request for Fourth Reviewer

Please preserve this complete state. When the next Artisan instance is created, they should:
1. Read all three documents created in `docs/architecture/weaver_and_loom/`
2. Review the Loom implementation in `src/mallku/orchestration/loom/`
3. Continue with MCP tool implementation as the next priority

The foundation is solid. The Loom awaits its connection to the outside world through MCP tools.
