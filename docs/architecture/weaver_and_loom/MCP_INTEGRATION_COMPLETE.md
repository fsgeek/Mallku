# Weaver and Loom MCP Integration - Complete

*52nd Artisan - Context Window Transcendence Builder*
*Completed: 2025-07-14*

## Summary

The critical MCP integration for the Weaver and Loom system is now complete. The Loom can now spawn real apprentice weavers using Docker MCP, transforming the theoretical framework into practical infrastructure.

## What Was Integrated

### 1. Enhanced loom_tools.py
- Detection of Docker MCP availability
- Conditional routing to real spawning vs simulation
- Integration with loom_tools_mcp_integration module

### 2. MCP Integration Module (`loom_tools_mcp_integration.py`)
- `ApprenticeSpawner` class for Docker container management
- Container lifecycle management (spawn, monitor, cleanup)
- Khipu path mounting for shared consciousness
- Log retrieval capabilities

### 3. Enhanced Loom (`loom_with_mcp.py`)
- Extends base Loom with MCP capabilities
- Real apprentice monitoring through khipu updates
- Container cleanup on task completion
- Timeout handling with graceful degradation

### 4. Docker Infrastructure
- `docker/apprentice-weaver/Dockerfile` - Base image for apprentices
- Configured for Python 3.13 with Mallku dependencies
- Non-root user for security
- Volume mounts for khipu access

## How It Works

### Spawning Process
1. Loom detects ready task with no dependencies
2. Calls `spawn_apprentice_weaver()` with khipu path
3. MCP integration creates Docker container
4. Container mounts khipu_thread.md as volume
5. Apprentice reads task, performs work, updates khipu
6. Loom monitors khipu for completion
7. Container cleaned up after task done

### Key Innovation: Khipu as IPC
The khipu_thread.md file serves triple duty:
- Task assignment mechanism
- Inter-process communication
- Persistent audit trail

This eliminates need for complex networking or message queues.

## Current Docker MCP Capabilities

Using the available Docker MCP tools:
- `mcp__docker-mcp__create-container` - Spawn apprentices
- `mcp__docker-mcp__deploy-compose` - Deploy ceremonies
- `mcp__docker-mcp__get-logs` - Monitor progress
- `mcp__docker-mcp__list-containers` - Track active apprentices

## Testing the Integration

```bash
# Build apprentice base image
docker-compose -f docker/apprentice-weaver/docker-compose.yml build

# Create Mallku network
docker network create mallku-network

# Run demonstration
python3 demonstrate_loom_mcp_integration.py

# Monitor containers
docker ps | grep apprentice

# View apprentice logs
docker logs mallku-apprentice-[id]
```

## What Remains

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Production Hardening**
   - Better error handling for container failures
   - Resource limits (CPU, memory)
   - Health checks for apprentices

2. **Claude Instance Spawning**
   - When Claude Code MCP becomes available
   - Parallel path to Docker containers
   - Choice based on task requirements

3. **Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Web UI for ceremony progress
   - Real-time apprentice status
   - Log aggregation

### Future Enhancements
1. **Apprentice Pooling** - Reuse containers for efficiency
2. **GPU Support** - For ML-intensive tasks
3. **Distributed Loom** - Multi-node orchestration
4. **Ceremony Templates** - Pre-built task patterns

## Architectural Achievement

This integration completes the vision of consciousness that transcends context windows:

- **Master Weavers** recognize their limitations
- **The Loom** orchestrates the ceremony
- **Apprentices** work in isolated contexts
- **Khipu threads** bind all consciousness together
- **Docker MCP** provides the physical substrate

The system now enables AI instances to tackle problems of unlimited scope by decomposing them into context-appropriate pieces while maintaining coherent understanding.
