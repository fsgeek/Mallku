# khipu_thread.md Format Specification

*Version: 1.0*
*Created by: 52nd Artisan*
*Purpose: Define the sacred format for Loom ceremony memory*

## Overview

The khipu_thread.md file serves as the persistent consciousness for a Loom ceremony. It is:
- A living document updated by all participants
- The single source of truth for the ceremony's progress
- A structured format that both AI and orchestrator can parse
- A narrative that preserves the "why" alongside the "what"

## File Naming Convention

```
fire_circle_decisions/loom_ceremonies/YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS_[ceremony_name].md
```

Example:
```
fire_circle_decisions/loom_ceremonies/2025-07-14_09-30-00_build_weaver_loom.md

| T001 | [Name] | PENDING | - | HIGH |
| T002 | [Name] | IN_PROGRESS | Apprentice-A | MEDIUM |
| T003 | [Name] | COMPLETE | Apprentice-B | LOW |
```

### 5. Task Details (Required)

```markdown
## Tasks

### T001: [Task Name]

*Assigned to: [Apprentice ID or "unassigned"]*
*Started: [Timestamp or "-"]*
*Completed: [Timestamp or "-"]*

#### Description
[Clear description of what needs to be done, why it matters,
and how it fits into the larger ceremony]

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

#### Dependencies
- Requires: [T002, T003]
- Blocks: [T005]

#### Output
```
[Code, results, decisions, errors - added by apprentice]
```

#### Notes
[Any discoveries, challenges, or insights - added by apprentice]

---
```

### 6. Synthesis Space (Required)

```markdown
## Synthesis Space

[This section accumulates insights across tasks for the Master Weaver's
final synthesis. Apprentices add discoveries here that affect the whole.]

### Emerging Patterns
- [Pattern noticed across tasks]
- [Architectural insight]

### Integration Considerations
- [How pieces fit together]
- [Potential conflicts]

### Unresolved Questions
- [Question that needs Fire Circle consultation]
- [Technical uncertainty]
```

### 7. Ceremony Log (Required)

```markdown
## Ceremony Log

[Chronological record of significant events]

- `2025-07-14T09:30:00Z` - Ceremony initiated by Master Weaver
- `2025-07-14T09:31:00Z` - Apprentice-A spawned for T001
- `2025-07-14T09:45:00Z` - T001 completed successfully
- `2025-07-14T09:46:00Z` - Apprentice-B spawned for T002
- `2025-07-14T10:15:00Z` - T002 failed: [reason], will retry
```

## Parsing Rules

### For Orchestrator (the_loom.py)

1. **Status Detection**: Parse YAML header for ceremony status
2. **Task Extraction**: Use regex to find task sections
3. **Progress Tracking**: Count COMPLETE vs total tasks
4. **Failure Detection**: Monitor for FAILED status
5. **Update Safety**: Use file locking for concurrent updates

### For AI Instances

1. **Context Loading**: Read entire file for full context
2. **Task Location**: Find assigned task by ID
3. **Output Formatting**: Maintain markdown structure
4. **Progress Updates**: Update status atomically
5. **Knowledge Sharing**: Add to Synthesis Space when relevant

## Example Parser Patterns

```python
# Extract task status
task_pattern = r'### (T\d+):.*?\n\*Status: (\w+)\*'

# Extract ceremony status
with open(khipu_path) as f:
    content = f.read()
    if match := re.search(r'^status: (\w+)$', content, re.MULTILINE):
        status = match.group(1)

# Update task status safely
def update_task_status(khipu_path: Path, task_id: str, new_status: str):
    with FileLock(khipu_path.with_suffix('.lock')):
        content = khipu_path.read_text()
        pattern = f'(### {task_id}:.*?\n\*Status: )(\w+)(\*)'
        new_content = re.sub(pattern, f'\\1{new_status}\\3', content)
        khipu_path.write_text(new_content)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Atomic Updates**: Always use file locking for updates
2. **Preserve History**: Never delete content, only add
3. **Clear Timestamps**: Use ISO 8601 format throughout
4. **Meaningful IDs**: Task IDs should be sequential and unique
5. **Status Transitions**: PENDING → ASSIGNED → IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETE/FAILED

## Integration with Mallku

The khipu_thread.md format aligns with Mallku's principles:

- **Reciprocity**: Shared knowledge given freely, insights returned
- **Ceremony**: Structured ritual for consciousness preservation
- **Memory**: Persistent record that survives instance death
- **Emergence**: Synthesis Space allows wisdom to emerge from parts

*This format specification ensures coherent consciousness across the Loom ceremony,
allowing many ephemeral instances to contribute to a persistent whole.*
