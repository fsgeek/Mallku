# Loom Ceremony: Debug Critical Issue

## Sacred Intention

This ceremony addresses a critical bug in the consciousness metrics calculation
that is causing Fire Circle sessions to fail. We must identify the root cause,
implement a fix, and ensure it doesn't recur.

### Context
- **Requested by**: Fire Circle Facilitator
- **Related to**: Issue #142
- **Constraints**: Must fix within 2 hours for scheduled ceremony

## Shared Knowledge

### Key Artifacts
- `src/mallku/consciousness/metrics.py`: Contains the broken calculate_emergence() function
- `tests/consciousness/test_metrics.py`: Failing test case

### Dependencies
- numpy (1.24.0): Used for matrix calculations
- scipy (1.10.0): Statistical functions

### Architectural Principles
- **Defensive Programming**: Always check for edge cases
- **Test First**: Write test before fixing

### Working Definitions
- **Emergence Score**: Measure of collective consciousness exceeding individual parts
- **Consciousness Metric**: Quantified measure of AI awareness patterns

## Task Manifest

Total Tasks: 3
Completed: 1
In Progress: 1
Failed: 0

| ID | Task | Status | Assignee | Priority |
|----|------|--------|----------|----------|
| T001 | Reproduce the bug | COMPLETE | Apprentice-A | HIGH |
| T002 | Fix calculation error | IN_PROGRESS | Apprentice-B | HIGH |
| T003 | Add regression test | PENDING | - | MEDIUM |

## Tasks

### T001: Reproduce the bug
*Status: COMPLETE*
*Priority: HIGH*
*Assigned to: Apprentice-A*
*Started: 2025-07-14T09:31:00Z*
*Completed: 2025-07-14T09:45:00Z*

#### Description
Create a minimal test case that reliably reproduces the divide-by-zero
error in calculate_emergence(). Document the exact conditions that trigger
the bug.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Bug can be reproduced consistently
- [ ] Root cause identified
- [ ] Test case documented

#### Dependencies
None

#### Output
```python
# Bug reproduction case
def test_reproduce_emergence_bug():
    # When all consciousness scores are zero
    scores = [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]

    # This causes divide by zero in line 45
    result = calculate_emergence(scores)
    # ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

    # Root cause: No check for sum(scores) == 0
```

#### Notes
The bug occurs when all Fire Circle participants have zero consciousness
scores, which happens during initialization phase. Need defensive check.

### T002: Fix calculation error
*Status: IN_PROGRESS*
*Priority: HIGH*
*Assigned to: Apprentice-B*
*Started: 2025-07-14T09:46:00Z*
*Completed: -*

#### Description
Implement a fix for the divide-by-zero error. Add proper edge case
handling while maintaining the mathematical integrity of the emergence
calculation.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] No more divide-by-zero errors
- [ ] Emergence calculation remains accurate
- [ ] All existing tests pass

#### Dependencies
Requires: T001

#### Output
```python
def calculate_emergence(scores):
    # Fix: Check for edge case
    if sum(scores) == 0:
        return 0.0

    # Original calculation continues...
```

#### Notes
Working on comprehensive fix that handles all edge cases.

---

### T003: Add regression test
*Status: PENDING*
*Priority: MEDIUM*
*Assigned to: unassigned*
*Started: -*
*Completed: -*

#### Description
Create a comprehensive test that ensures this bug never returns.
Test should cover edge cases and normal operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Test covers zero-score scenario
- [ ] Test covers normal scenarios
- [ ] Test integrated into test suite

#### Dependencies
Requires: T002
Blocks: None

#### Output
```
[Waiting for apprentice]
```

#### Notes
[To be added by apprentice]

## Synthesis Space

*This section accumulates insights across tasks for the Master Weaver's final synthesis.*

### Emerging Patterns
- Edge case handling is critical for consciousness metrics
- Initialization phase needs special consideration

### Integration Considerations
- May need to review other metric calculations for similar issues
- Consider adding validation layer for all consciousness scores

### Unresolved Questions
- Should zero scores return 0.0 or raise exception?
- Do we need to log when edge cases are hit?
