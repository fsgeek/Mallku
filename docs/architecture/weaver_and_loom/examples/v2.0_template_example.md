# Loom Ceremony: Feature Creation Ceremony

## Sacred Intention

This ceremony brings new capabilities to life within Mallku. We create
"Ceremony Performance Dashboard" not merely as code, but as a
living addition to the cathedral.

Success means building something that integrates harmoniously with what exists,
serves real needs, and can be maintained by future guardians. We build with
intention, test with care, and document with clarity.

### Context
- **Requested by**: 68th Guardian
- **Related to**: Issue #215 (weaver-and-loom enhancements)
- **Constraints**: Must integrate with existing monitoring infrastructure

## Shared Knowledge

### Key Artifacts
- `src/mallku/orchestration/loom/`: Loom orchestration system
- `src/mallku/web/dashboard/`: Existing dashboard infrastructure
- `src/mallku/metrics/`: Metrics collection framework

### Dependencies
- FastAPI (0.104.1): Web framework for dashboard
- Plotly (5.18.0): Interactive visualizations
- SQLAlchemy (2.0.23): Database ORM

### Architectural Principles
- **Observability First**: Every ceremony should be observable
- **Real-time Insights**: Dashboards update as ceremonies progress
- **Historical Analysis**: Learn from past ceremony patterns

### Working Definitions
- **Ceremony Performance**: Measure of how well a ceremony achieved its sacred purpose
- **Reciprocity Score**: Balance between effort invested and value delivered
- **Task Decomposition Quality**: How well tasks were broken down and distributed

# Ceremony Performance Dashboard Architecture

## Overview
Three-layer architecture:
1. **Collection Layer**: Gathers metrics from running ceremonies
2. **Storage Layer**: Time-series database for performance data
3. **Visualization Layer**: Real-time and historical dashboards

## Components
- `CeremonyMetricsCollector`: Subscribes to ceremony events
- `PerformanceDatabase`: Stores metrics with proper indexing
- `DashboardAPI`: FastAPI endpoints for data access
- `DashboardUI`: React components for visualization

## Integration Points
- Hooks into existing `khipu_thread.md` update events
- Uses Mallku metrics framework for standardization
- Integrates with existing web dashboard navigation
```

#### Notes
Architecture follows event-driven pattern to minimize performance impact
on running ceremonies. Using WebSocket for real-time updates.

## Synthesis Space

*This section accumulates insights across tasks for the Master Weaver's final synthesis.*

### Emerging Patterns
- Event-driven architecture minimizes performance impact
- Separation of collection and visualization enables flexibility
- Real-time monitoring reveals ceremony bottlenecks immediately
- Template-based ceremonies show consistent performance patterns

### Integration Considerations
- WebSocket connections need careful management in production
- Time-series data grows quickly - need retention policy
- Dashboard security needs to align with Mallku's access control
- Consider integrating with existing Grafana infrastructure

### Unresolved Questions
- Should we aggregate metrics by template type?
- What retention period for historical data?
- Do we need alerting for failed ceremonies?
- How to handle metrics for long-running ceremonies (days)?

### Template Insights
- Feature Creation Ceremony template generates consistent task structures
- Task dependencies help predict ceremony completion time
- Sacred purpose alignment affects completion rates
