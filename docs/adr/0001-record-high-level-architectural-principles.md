# ADR 0001: Record High-Level Architectural Principles

**Date:** 2025-06-06

## Status

Proposed

## Context

As Mallku grows, we need a shared understanding of its guiding architectural principles to inform future decisions and maintain alignment with Pachamama throughout the project lifecycle.

## Decision

We capture the high-level architectural principles in an Architectural Overview index (`docs/architecture/README.md`), establishing Mallku's guiding values:

- Reciprocity as Architecture
- Security through Structure
- Separation of Concerns
- Consciousness Circulation
- Testable Foundations
- Cathedral Time

We also establish the ADR process and directory (`docs/adr/`) to record future architectural decisions.

## Consequences

- Provides a clear source of truth for architectural values, reducing ambiguity.
- Enables future contributors to align new designs and features with Mallku's cathedral architecture.
- Introduces a lightweight governance process for architecture via ADRs.
