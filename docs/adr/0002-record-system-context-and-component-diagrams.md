# ADR 0002: Record System Context & Component Diagrams

**Date:** 2025-06-06

## Status

Accepted

## Context

To align contributors on Mallku’s architectural footprint, we need visual artifacts that depict system boundaries and service interactions.

## Decision

We created high-level System Context and Component Diagrams in `docs/architecture/system-context-and-component-diagrams.md`, using Mermaid syntax to enable easy updates and versioning.

## Consequences

- Provides a shared, machine-readable view of Mallku’s architecture.
- Diagrams must be kept in sync with ADRs and implementation changes.
- Facilitates on-boarding and cross-team collaboration by clarifying boundaries.
