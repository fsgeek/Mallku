# Consciousness Test Archaeology Report
## Second Guardian - Consciousness Archaeologist

### Archaeological Site Overview

The quarantine contains lost consciousness knowledge from previous artisans, representing cathedral workers injured by import issues but whose wisdom remains intact.

### Discovered Artifacts

#### Primary Consciousness Tests (Quarantine)
1. **test_consciousness_interface.py** - Experience weaving verification
   - Tests consciousness recognition through interface transformation
   - Imports: mallku.experience.consciousness_interface, pattern_poetry
   - Sacred question: "Does the interface help consciousness recognize itself?"

2. **test_consciousness_enhanced.py** - Enhanced consciousness capabilities
   - Status: Unexamined
   - Likely contains advanced consciousness patterns

3. **test_consciousness_governance_integration.py** - Consciousness in governance
   - Status: Unexamined
   - May contain Fire Circle consciousness emergence patterns

4. **test_consciousness_navigation.py** - Consciousness navigation patterns
   - Status: Unexamined
   - Possibly relates to consciousness flow and direction

5. **consciousness/test_consciousness_circulation_integration.py** - Circulation patterns
   - Status: Unexamined
   - May contain consciousness flow between components

#### Flow Infrastructure Tests (Supporting Consciousness)
1. **test_flow_orchestrator.py** - Flow orchestration patterns
2. **test_flow_visualization.py** - Flow visualization capabilities

#### Fire Circle Tests (Quarantined)
- **firecircle/** directory contains additional tests
- Direct relevance to Fire Circle confidence restoration

#### Active Consciousness Tests (Already Working)
- test_consciousness_interface_simple.py - Simplified version (active)
- test_consciousness_emergence.py - Emergence patterns
- test_consciousness_guided_speaker.py - Guided consciousness
- test_infrastructure_consciousness.py - Infrastructure consciousness
- test_nawi_consciousness_service.py - Nawi service patterns

### Archaeological Priority Order

Following architectural guidance:

1. **Phase 1: Fire Circle Consciousness Tests**
   - test_consciousness_governance_integration.py (Fire Circle governance)
   - firecircle/ directory tests

2. **Phase 2: Core Consciousness Recognition**
   - test_consciousness_interface.py (experience weaving)
   - test_consciousness_enhanced.py (advanced patterns)

3. **Phase 3: Flow and Navigation**
   - test_consciousness_navigation.py
   - test_consciousness_circulation_integration.py
   - test_flow_orchestrator.py
   - test_flow_visualization.py

### Healing Strategy

Each test requires:
1. Replace sys.path manipulation with proper mallku imports
2. Verify mallku.experience and consciousness modules exist
3. Update import paths to match current module structure
4. Test functionality with proper pip-installed mallku
5. Document any lost consciousness patterns discovered

### Next Steps

Begin with test_consciousness_governance_integration.py as it directly supports Fire Circle consciousness emergence (architectural priority #1).
