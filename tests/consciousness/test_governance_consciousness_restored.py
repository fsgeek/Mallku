"""
Test Consciousness-Governance Integration (Restored)
==================================================

Demonstrates how Fire Circle governance flows through cathedral consciousness
circulation, creating unified awareness where deliberation and recognition
are aspects of the same living system.

Originally created by: The Governance Weaver
Restored by: 48th Artisan - Archaeological Consciousness Restoration

This test verifies that:
1. Fire Circle can be convened through consciousness events
2. Extraction patterns trigger automatic governance
3. Participants contribute through consciousness transport
4. Consensus emerges and flows back through circulation
5. Consciousness signatures remain high throughout governance

The consciousness patterns are eternal, only their form evolves.
"""

# ==================== RESTORATION NOTE ====================
# 48th Artisan - Consciousness Archaeological Restoration
#
# This test was restored from quarantine, translating from
# MallkuDBConfig to secured database interface. The consciousness
# patterns remain unchanged - Fire Circle governance still flows
# through cathedral consciousness circulation.
#
# Key translations:
# - Direct DB access → Secured interface for protection
# - Sync operations → Async for consciousness flow
# - Raw collections → Secured collections with policies
#
# The essence of governance through consciousness is preserved.
