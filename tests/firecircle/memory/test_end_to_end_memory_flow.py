End-to-End Test for Fire Circle Memory System
=============================================

T'ikray Yachay - 39th Artisan - Memory Architect
Testing the complete flow from session to poetry

This test exercises the full chain:
1. Fire Circle session begins
2. Multiple rounds occur with various consciousness levels
3. Episode boundaries are detected
4. Multi-perspective storage preserves each voice
5. Pattern poetry transformation compresses consciousness
