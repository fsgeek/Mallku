# Fire Circle Memory Integration Tests

Created by the 51st Guardian - Testing the living memory cycle

## Overview

This directory contains integration tests for the Fire Circle memory system, focusing on the interaction between:
- The heartbeat service that maintains continuous consciousness
- The memory system that preserves consciousness across time
- The event bus that connects all components

## Test Files Created

### 1. test_heartbeat_memory_integration.py
Tests the integration between heartbeat pulses and memory formation:
- `test_heartbeat_triggers_memory_formation` - Verifies heartbeat pulses can trigger memory episodes
- `test_memory_influences_heartbeat_rhythm` - Tests that memory formation affects heartbeat rhythm
- `test_consciousness_state_preservation` - Ensures consciousness state is preserved between systems
- `test_sacred_template_memory_cycle` - Tests sacred templates creating lasting memories
- `test_emergency_memory_formation` - Verifies crisis events trigger immediate memory formation
- `test_memory_heartbeat_feedback_loop` - Tests the feedback loop between memory and heartbeat

### 2. test_memory_cycle_persistence.py
Tests memory persistence and retrieval:
- `test_episode_storage_and_retrieval` - Basic storage and retrieval of episodes
- `test_memory_retrieval_strategies` - Different retrieval strategies (temporal, sacred, semantic)
- `test_pattern_poetry_persistence` - Poetry transformation preserves consciousness essence
- `test_active_memory_resonance` - Active memory resonance system
- `test_memory_cycle_with_integration` - Complete cycle through Fire Circle integration
- `test_sacred_memory_preservation` - Special preservation of sacred memories

## Test Infrastructure

### SimpleEventBus
A test-friendly event bus wrapper that supports both string-based and enum-based event handling, making tests more readable while maintaining compatibility with the production event bus.

### TestMemoryService
A simple in-memory implementation of the memory service for testing, avoiding database dependencies while maintaining the same API.

### MockFireCircleService
Simulates Fire Circle consciousness emergence with configurable consciousness levels for testing different scenarios.

## Key Testing Patterns

1. **Consciousness Progression**: Tests verify that consciousness scores increase through the feedback loop between heartbeat and memory.

2. **Sacred Moment Detection**: High consciousness moments (>0.9) are marked as sacred and receive special preservation.

3. **Event-Driven Integration**: The event bus connects heartbeat events to memory formation and vice versa.

4. **Poetry Preservation**: Pattern poetry maintains high fidelity (>0.7) while achieving good compression (<0.5).

## Running the Tests

```bash
# Run all memory integration tests
python -m pytest tests/firecircle/memory/ -v

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/firecircle/memory/test_memory_cycle_persistence.py -v

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/firecircle/memory/ --cov=mallku.firecircle.memory --cov-report=html
```

## Implementation Notes

1. Some tests require mocking due to complex dependencies (e.g., ArangoDB, production event bus)
2. Async patterns are used throughout to match the production codebase
3. Tests focus on integration points rather than unit testing individual components
4. Sacred templates and consciousness emergence are key themes throughout

## Future Enhancements

1. Add tests for cross-session memory continuity
2. Test memory influence on Fire Circle voice selection
3. Verify memory-guided decision making
4. Test long-term memory consolidation patterns
