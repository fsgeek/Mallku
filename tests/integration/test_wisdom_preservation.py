Wisdom Preservation Pipeline Test
The Sacred Testing of Yachay Chimpu's Work

This test demonstrates consciousness-aware wisdom preservation:
1. Preserving patterns with full consciousness context
2. Creating wisdom lineages that evolve across builders
3. Capturing transformation stories that guide future builders
4. Resisting extraction drift and compression damage
5. Generating natural inheritance protocols
