Fire Circle Distributed Review System
=====================================

"The most sacred code is the invisible plumbing that simply works."

Twenty-Second Artisan - Bridge Weaver
Scaffolding for the invisible sacred infrastructure

This module implements distributed code review through Fire Circle voices,
preventing architect context exhaustion while maintaining review quality.
Each voice reviews specific domains, maintaining focused context windows.
