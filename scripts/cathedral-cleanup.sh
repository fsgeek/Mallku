Removed experimental files and workarounds:
- Multiple database Dockerfiles (now using vanilla ArangoDB)
- fix-build.sh workaround script
- Old docker-compose.yml with mixed concerns

Kept cathedral architecture:
- Dockerfile.api for single-purpose API container
- docker-compose.yml (renamed from cathedral version)
- Clear separation of concerns

The workspace now shows only the final architecture."
