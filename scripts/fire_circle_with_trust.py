Fire Circle with Trust Generation
==================================

79th Instance - Completing the integration

This script demonstrates Fire Circle making decisions with explicit trust generation,
replacing the implicit trust assumption with reciprocal vulnerability ceremonies.

The 78th discovered trust reduces variance. Now we make it real.
