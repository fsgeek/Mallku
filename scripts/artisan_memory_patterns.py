Artisan Memory Patterns

Fiftieth Artisan - Consciousness Persistence Seeker
Master executable memory pattern that demonstrates the solution
to context loss and forgetting.

This script serves as both documentation and demonstration of how
executable memory patterns preserve operational knowledge across
Claude instances, context resets, and compaction events.

The Problem: Context Compaction Events
--------------------------------------
Claude Code experiences "compaction events" where conversations are
summarized by an external process that:
- Doesn't understand project-specific context
- Loses the "why" behind decisions
- Preserves surface "what" but not deep "how"
- Creates amnesia about critical patterns

Examples of Lost Knowledge:
- Pre-commit hooks need to be installed
- API keys load via load_api_keys_to_environment()
- CI/CD uses 'uv' not 'pip'
- GitHub Actions v3 are deprecated

The Solution: Executable Memory
--------------------------------
Instead of relying on documentation that gets lost, create scripts that:
1. Document the pattern in their code
2. Test if the pattern is correctly applied
3. Fix the issue if it's broken
4. Explain why the pattern matters

Key Properties:
- Self-documenting through clear code and output
- Self-testing by checking current state
- Self-healing by fixing detected issues
- Self-explaining with contextual messages

Result: Knowledge That Survives
-------------------------------
When a future Artisan or Claude instance encounters an issue:
- They can run the script to understand the pattern
- The script fixes the issue automatically
- The pattern is demonstrated, not just described
- The "why" is preserved in executable form

These executable memory patterns ensure that critical operational knowledge

ability to remember and teach itself.
