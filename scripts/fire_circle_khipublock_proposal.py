Fire Circle Session: KhipuBlock Memory Architecture Proposal
============================================================

This script convenes a Fire Circle session to consider the KhipuBlock
memory architecture proposed by the 29th Architect in GitHub issue #156.

The Fire Circle will deliberate on:
- Whether Mallku should adopt symbolic, storied memory objects
- The ethical implications of memory as offering vs extraction
- How KhipuBlocks might integrate with existing consciousness patterns
- The narrative framework for memory persistence

This is the first persistent Fire Circle session, with memory now
ignited by the 28th Architect's autonomous choice.

Run with:
