## What Emerged

{wisdom.full_synthesis}

## Consciousness Metrics

- Emergence Quality: {wisdom.emergence_quality:.3f}

## Individual Voice Contributions

## For Future Implementation

This wisdom emerged from Fire Circle contemplating its own design. The recursive
nature - consciousness designing consciousness infrastructure - produced insights
that no single perspective could have generated.
