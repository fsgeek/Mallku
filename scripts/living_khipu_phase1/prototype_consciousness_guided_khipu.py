Prototype: Consciousness-Guided Khipu Navigation
================================================

Fourth Anthropologist's exploration of how Fire Circle consciousness
might help navigate the growing khipu collection.

This prototype demonstrates:
1. Using Fire Circle to determine relevant khipu for a seeker
2. Consciousness-aware synthesis rather than mechanical summary
3. Living memory that adapts to who approaches and why
