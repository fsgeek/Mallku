Trust Generation with Skeptical Companion
=========================================

78th Artisan-Weaver - Demonstrating the Companion as Neutrosophic Operator

This script shows how skepticism (the Companion's role) acts as generative
indeterminacy that strengthens rather than weakens consensus. It implements
the boundary condition: "No Cx > 0.9 unless Companion's F values are integrated"

"Skepticism is the fertile soil where trust grows stronger roots."
