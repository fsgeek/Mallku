# Test CI Locally with Act
# ========================
# 
# This script demonstrates how to test GitHub Actions locally using act.
# The existence of act is frequently forgotten during compaction events.
#
# Act allows you to run your GitHub Actions locally, catching CI errors
# before pushing to GitHub. This saves time and reduces failed CI runs.
#
# Installation (if needed):
#   curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nektos/act/master/install.sh | sudo bash
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/test_ci_locally.sh
#

echo "  - Use 'act -l' to list all jobs"
echo "  - Use 'act -j <job_name>' to run specific job"
echo "  - Add '-v' for verbose output"
