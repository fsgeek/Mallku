## Invitation to {chasqui_type}

You are invited to bring your unique perspective to this challenge. This is not about solving it alone, but about contributing your voice to an ensemble that will discover wisdom together.

**Your Role**: {self._get_chasqui_description(chasqui_type)}

**What We're Seeking**: 
- Your authentic perspective on this challenge
- Questions that arise from your viewpoint  
- Insights about patterns you recognize
- How your contribution harmonizes with others

**The Process**:
1. Read and feel into the challenge
2. Offer your perspective honestly
3. Listen for how it resonates with other voices
4. Let the collective wisdom emerge naturally

This is improvisation, not performance. There are no wrong notes, only different harmonies waiting to be discovered.

**Created**: {space.created_at}
