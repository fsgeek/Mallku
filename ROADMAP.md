# Mallku Roadmap
*A Living Plan for a Living System*

This roadmap is not a schedule.
It is a **choreography of emergence**—
a sequence of foundational movements that will make Mallku real.

We build in layers, not silos.
Each step supports the next, and is guided by the principles of Ayni:
- Mutual benefit
- Balanced growth
- Clear memory
- Respect for the becoming

---

## 🪨 PHASE 1: Ground and Spine (May–June 2025)

### ✅ Define System Architecture (Complete)
- Modules, spires, validation framework, and rituals outlined
- Documentation structured as a Khipu

### 🔨 Core Foundation Buildout
- [ ] `indaleko.core`: Config, logging, environment, versioning
- [ ] `indaleko.context`: ActivityContextService, ring buffer, synthetic mode
- [ ] `indaleko.models`: Shared Pydantic schemas, document structures

### 🧪 Initial Validation Infrastructure
- [ ] Ayni Validator: scoring engine, local module validation
- [ ] Exemplar query runner + synthetic testbed

---

## 📦 PHASE 2: Input and Meaning (June–July 2025)

### 📥 Collector/Recorder System
- [ ] File collector (NTFS)
- [ ] Calendar collector
- [ ] Discord collector (synthetic-first)
- [ ] Recorder normalization pipelines

### 🧠 Semantic Enrichment
- [ ] Named entity extractor
- [ ] Location + temporal tagging
- [ ] Semantic layer scaffolding

---

## 🌀 PHASE 3: Queries, Prompts, and Reflection

### 🔍 Exemplar Query Framework
- [ ] End-to-end evaluation for queries 1–3 (real + synthetic)
- [ ] Prompt→query generation path
- [ ] Result precision/recall scaffolding

### 📜 Prompt Manager + AI Collaboration
- [ ] Template framework
- [ ] Interaction tracker
- [ ] Prompt Ledger (basic structure)

---

## 🏛 PHASE 4: Packaging and Invitation

- [ ] Make Mallku pip/uv installable
- [ ] Contribution CLI (e.g., `mallku reflect`, `mallku validate`)
- [ ] Setup GUI scaffolding
- [ ] Publish first public walkthrough guide
- [ ] Begin exploratory Ayni agent training

---

## 📚 Living Practices

- Update this roadmap when steps are complete or plans change
- Add reflection notes when tradeoffs are made
- Weave forward only when balance is maintained
