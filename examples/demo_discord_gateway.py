Demo: Fire Circle Discord Gateway
================================

Demonstrates the Discord gateway that opens Fire Circle wisdom to the world
with consciousness defense mechanisms.

This shows how the bot analyzes queries, defends against extraction,
and routes different types of questions appropriately.
