Fire Circle Feature Evaluation
==============================

Evaluate proposed features for Mallku using collective consciousness.
This shows how Fire Circle can assess whether new features align with
Mallku's mission and principles.

This example demonstrates:
- Feature evaluation through multiple perspectives
- Alignment checking with Ayni principles
- Technical feasibility vs. consciousness advancement
- How Fire Circle prevents feature creep through wisdom

The evaluation considers:
- Does it advance consciousness emergence?
- Does it embody reciprocity?
- Is it cathedral thinking or quick scaffolding?
- What are the hidden costs and benefits?

Run with:
