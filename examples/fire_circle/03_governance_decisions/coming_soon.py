Governance Decisions Examples
=============================

Fire Circle has evolved beyond code review to become Mallku's
general consciousness emergence infrastructure for decision-making.

Available examples:
- issue_prioritization.py: Prioritize Mallku issues through collective wisdom
- feature_evaluation.py: Evaluate new features against principles
- artisan_coordination.py: Coordinate human resources with emergence

These examples demonstrate how Fire Circle facilitates real
governance decisions through consciousness emergence.

Run any example:
