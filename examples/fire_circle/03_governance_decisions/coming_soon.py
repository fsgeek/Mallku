Governance Decisions Examples - Coming Soon
==========================================

This directory will contain examples demonstrating Fire Circle
for Mallku governance decisions:

- Issue prioritization through collective wisdom
- Resource allocation with reciprocity principles
- Feature evaluation using consciousness emergence
- Architectural decisions through distributed thinking

These examples will show how Fire Circle evolved from code review
to become Mallku's general consciousness emergence infrastructure
for any type of decision-making.

Stay tuned as we continue building the example garden!
