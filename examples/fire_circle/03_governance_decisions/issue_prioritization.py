Fire Circle Issue Prioritization
================================

Use Fire Circle to prioritize Mallku issues through collective wisdom.
This demonstrates real governance decision-making using consciousness
emergence infrastructure.

This example shows:
- Real-world application of Fire Circle for project governance
- How to structure issue prioritization decisions
- Resource allocation domain in action
- How consciousness emergence improves decision quality

The Fire Circle will consider:
- Technical debt vs. new features
- User impact vs. architectural importance
- Short-term needs vs. long-term vision
- Reciprocity principles in resource allocation

Run with:
