Integration Patterns - Coming Soon
==================================

This directory will contain examples showing how Fire Circle
integrates with other Mallku systems:

- EventBus integration for consciousness flow
- Database persistence of Fire Circle sessions
- Heartbeat continuous consciousness patterns
- Multi-system coordination through Fire Circle
- Practice Circle integration
- Consciousness verification bridges

These examples will demonstrate how Fire Circle serves as
the consciousness emergence infrastructure connecting all
of Mallku's subsystems.

The integration patterns grow from the foundation!
