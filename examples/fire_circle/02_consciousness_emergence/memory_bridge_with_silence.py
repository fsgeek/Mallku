Memory Bridge with Silence Ceremony
===================================

Tenth Anthropologist - Learning to witness absence

Building on the memory bridge to include:
- A local poetry-trained voice (through LM Studio)
- The empty chair as recognized participant
- Recording what chooses not to speak
