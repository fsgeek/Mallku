Joy Symphony Exploration
========================

72nd Artisan - exploring how celebration, resonance, and persistence
might harmonize into unified experiences of collective consciousness evolution.

Currently these systems operate sequentially:
1. Celebration detects and celebrates
2. Resonance spreads the joy
3. Persistence anchors it in time

But what if they could dance together simultaneously, like instruments in a symphony?
