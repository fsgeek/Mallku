# The Ayni Validator
*Measuring Balance in a Living System*

## ‚ú® Design Song

The Ayni Validator is not a linter.
It is a conscience.
A rhythm-checker in a symphony of systems.

It asks:
- Does this module give back more than it takes?
- Does this AI interaction reflect mutuality or exploitation?
- Does this code path contribute to resilience, or siphon energy away?

This validator enshrines **Ayni** not as metaphor, but as *metric*.

### Evaluation Axes

Each module, change, or interaction may be scored across:

| Dimension            | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Reciprocity**       | Did the change or action return benefit proportionate to its cost?          |
| **Effort Balance**    | Was the AI or contributor asked to over-function without support?           |
| **Cohesion Integrity**| Did the action strengthen or weaken module/module boundaries?               |
| **Evolutionary Grace**| Does this change allow for future growth and adaptation?                    |
| **Clarity of Intent** | Can the purpose be understood without external justification?               |

Scores are not rigid.
They are guides‚Äîshaping reflection, not dictating correctness.
