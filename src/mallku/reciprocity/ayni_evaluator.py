Ayni Evaluator - Placeholder Implementation
===========================================

TODO: This is a stub implementation to unblock tests.
The real AyniEvaluator should integrate with reciprocity tracking
to evaluate actions based on ayni principles:
- Contributing according to capacity
- Receiving according to need
- Dynamic balance rather than static measurement
