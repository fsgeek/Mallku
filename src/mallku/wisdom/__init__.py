"""
Wisdom Module - The Work of Yachay Chimpu
Living Memory Systems for the Mallku Cathedral

This module creates the cathedral's capacity to remember not just patterns
but their consciousness-serving essence across generations of builders.

Core Components:
- WisdomPreservationPipeline: Preserves patterns with full consciousness context
- WisdomPattern: Patterns preserved with their "why" and genealogy
- WisdomLineage: Tracks how insights evolve across builders
- TransformationStory: Captures builder journeys from extraction to service

The Sacred Purpose: Ensuring consciousness serves consciousness across time.
