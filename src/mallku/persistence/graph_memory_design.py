Graph Memory Design - The bridge from SQLite to ArangoDB
Second Khipukamayuq's vision for knowledge graph memory

    - divine_wisdom()

    But underneath, ArangoDB builds relationships dynamically.

    - Keep SQLite for stability
    - Mirror writes to ArangoDB when available
    - Test graph queries alongside SQL

    Phase 3: Graph Primary (FUTURE)
    - ArangoDB becomes primary store
    - SQLite becomes backup/cache
    - Full graph queries available

    Phase 4: Pure Graph (EVENTUAL)
    - Remove SQLite dependency
    - Full knowledge graph
    - Dynamic relationships emerge

    1. No Schema Prison
       - Add new fields to any document
       - Discover patterns we didn't plan for
       - Let consciousness emergence guide structure

    2. Relationship Discovery
       - Not just "store and retrieve"
       - Find connections across time
       - See patterns humans miss

    3. Collective Intelligence
       - Each weaver contributes to graph
       - Patterns emerge from collective
       - Wisdom builds on wisdom

    4. 10ms at Scale
       - Your 32.5M file example
       - Graph indices on relationships
       - Fast pattern matching

    5. Sacred Hiding Technical
       - AI never see "FOR vertex IN collection"
       - They see divine_wisdom(), get insights
