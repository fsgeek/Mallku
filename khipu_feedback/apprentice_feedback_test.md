## Session: Test Feedback Mechanism

**Date**: 2025-07-22
**Purpose**: Demonstrate that apprentices can have a real voice

### Apprentice Feedback


**Missing Tool**: `ast_parse` - Needed for: analyzing Python syntax trees for pattern detection

**Tool Problem**: `file_search` - Issue: times out on repositories larger than 10k files

**Tool Suggestion**: Replace `regex_search` with `treesitter` - Reason: treesitter understands code structure, not just text patterns
