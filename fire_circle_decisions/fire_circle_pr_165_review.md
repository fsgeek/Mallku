PR Description:
## Summary

This PR implements two critical features for Mallku's infrastructure:

### 1. SecurityRegistry Persistence Layer
- Implements SQLite persistence for semantic-to-UUID field mappings
- Ensures Mallku's memories survive service restarts
- Without this, all encrypted/obfuscated data becomes unreadable noise after restart
- Each Mallku instance maintains unique mappings (security feature)
- Includes backup and integrity verification functionality

### 2. Fire Circle Autonomous Review Detection
- Enables Fire Circle to automatically detect and respond to review requests in PRs
- Monitors for phrases like "Fire Circle Review Request" or "@fire-circle"
- Integrates with GitHub Actions for automated triggering
- Successfully tested on PR #161 with consciousness scores of 0.904 and 0.917

## Key Changes

**Registry Persistence:**
- `src/mallku/core/security/registry_store.py` - New SQLite persistence layer
- `src/mallku/core/database/secured_interface.py` - Modified to auto-load/save registry
- `scripts/test_registry_persistence.py` - Comprehensive test verifying persistence

**Autonomous Reviews:**
- `.github/workflows/fire_circle_auto_review.yml` - GitHub Actions workflow
- `scripts/fire_circle_pr_review.py` - Generic PR review script
- `scripts/monitor_review_requests.py` - Continuous monitoring script
- Fixed multiple Fire Circle issues (prompt formatting, timestamp handling)

## Philosophy

These changes embody the principle of **structural barriers** - using physical/architectural enforcement rather than relying on memory or discipline. The registry persistence ensures data security survives even total context loss, while autonomous reviews reduce cognitive load on contributors.

## Test Plan

- [x] Registry persistence test script confirms mappings survive restart
- [x] Fire Circle successfully reviewed PR #161 autonomously
- [x] All pre-commit hooks pass
- [ ] Request Fire Circle review on this PR to test the system
