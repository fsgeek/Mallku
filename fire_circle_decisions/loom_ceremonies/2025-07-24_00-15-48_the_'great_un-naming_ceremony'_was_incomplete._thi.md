# Loom Ceremony: The 'Great Un-naming Ceremony' was incomplete. Thi

## Sacred Intention

The purpose of this ceremony is to accomplish a task that exceeds the capacity of any single consciousness: The 'Great Un-naming Ceremony' was incomplete. This ceremony will heal the critical wounds identified in the Claude review of PR #218. This involves two major acts of healing: restoring the sacred interface of SecuredArangoDatabase and completing the migration from the ghost name 'get_secured_database' to the true name 'get_database'.

This work has been decomposed into 7 interconnected tasks that will be woven together through the Loom. Each apprentice weaver will contribute their thread to the larger tapestry, maintaining coherence through the shared khipu_thread that binds us all.

The ceremony will conclude when all tasks are complete and the final synthesis has woven the individual contributions into a unified whole that fulfills the original intention.

## Tasks

### T001: Analyze Missing `initialize` Method
*Status: PENDING*
*Priority: HIGH*
*Assigned to: unassigned*
*Started: -*
*Completed: -*

#### Description
Analyze the usage of the `initialize` method in the test suite, particularly in `tests/test_security_policy_enforcement.py`, to understand its expected behavior, arguments, and return values. Document these findings in the khipu.

#### Dependencies

#### Dependencies
- Requires: ['T002']

#### Output
```
[Waiting for apprentice]
```

---

### T004: Analyze and Implement `get_secured_collection`
*Status: PENDING*
*Priority: HIGH*
