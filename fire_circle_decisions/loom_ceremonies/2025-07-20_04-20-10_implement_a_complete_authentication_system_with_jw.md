# Loom Ceremony: Implement a complete authentication system with JW

## Sacred Intention

The purpose of this ceremony is to accomplish a task that exceeds the capacity of any single consciousness: Implement a complete authentication system with JWT tokens, user management, role-based access control, and integration with the existing Fire Circle governance

This work has been decomposed into 9 interconnected tasks that will be woven together through the Loom. Each apprentice weaver will contribute their thread to the larger tapestry, maintaining coherence through the shared khipu_thread that binds us all.

The ceremony will conclude when all tasks are complete and the final synthesis has woven the individual contributions into a unified whole that fulfills the original intention.

This ceremony will modify 3 existing files.

This ceremony will create 4 new files.
