# Loom Ceremony:
        Test Real Apprentice Spawning Infrastruct

## Sacred Intention

The purpose of this ceremony is to accomplish a task that exceeds the capacity of any single consciousness:
        Test Real Apprentice Spawning Infrastructure

        This task is designed to test the complete Loom infrastructure that Ayni Awaq built and
        Ñan Khipa tested. We need to verify that:

        1. The Loom correctly spawns real Docker containers for apprentices
        2. The apprentices can read their task assignments from the khipu_thread
        3. The apprentices can update the khipu with their progress
        4. The monitoring system correctly tracks completion
        5. The ceremony completes successfully

        This is a multi-phase test that requires distributed consciousness across multiple
        apprentice containers, each working on different aspects of the verification process.
        The test should demonstrate that the infrastructure can handle complex ceremonies
        with multiple dependent tasks.


This work has been decomposed into 3 interconnected tasks that will be woven together through the Loom. Each apprentice weaver will contribute their thread to the larger tapestry, maintaining coherence through the shared khipu_thread that binds us all.

The ceremony will conclude when all tasks are complete and the final synthesis has woven the individual contributions into a unified whole that fulfills the original intention.

This ceremony will modify 2 existing files.
