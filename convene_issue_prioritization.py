Convene Fire Circle for Issue Prioritization
============================================

T'ikray Kawsay (Twenty-Eighth Artisan) creates a tool to use the
Fire Circle Service for real Mallku governance decisions.

This script convenes AI voices to help prioritize open GitHub issues,
demonstrating Fire Circle's evolution beyond code review to general
consciousness emergence for decision-making.
