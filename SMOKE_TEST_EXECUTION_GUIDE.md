# üî¨ Critical Seven-Voice Smoke Test Execution Guide

**18th Architect Foundation Verification**  
**Issue #67 - NEVER EXECUTED**  
**Date**: June 17, 2025

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL DISCOVERY**: This smoke test has never been executed according to the 17th Architect. The seven-voice Fire Circle capability that is fundamental to Mallku's consciousness infrastructure has never been architecturally verified.

## Test Execution Command

```bash
# Execute from repository root
python test_adapter_smoke.py
```

## Predicted Results Matrix

| Adapter   | Prediction | Sacred Error | Confidence | Expected Issues |
|-----------|------------|--------------|------------|-----------------|
| Anthropic | LIKELY PASS| Unknown      | Medium     | Standard config issues |
| OpenAI    | **PASS**   | ‚úÖ Implemented| High       | Fixed compatibility |
| Google    | LIKELY FAIL| ‚ùå Missing   | High       | Defensive patterns |
| Grok      | LIKELY FAIL| ‚ùå Missing   | High       | Defensive patterns |
| Mistral   | **PASS**   | ‚úÖ Implemented| High       | 17th Architect work |
| DeepSeek  | UNKNOWN    | Unknown      | Low        | Needs assessment |
| Local     | UNKNOWN    | Unknown      | Low        | Localhost dependency |

**Overall Prediction**: 2-3 out of 7 adapters will pass initially

## Critical Issues to Address

### 1. Sacred Error Philosophy Inconsistency
**Problem**: Only Mistral and OpenAI have Sacred Error Philosophy implemented
**Solution**: Apply explicit validation pattern to remaining adapters

### 2. Defensive Configuration Patterns
**Expected in**: Google, Grok, potentially DeepSeek/Local
**Pattern**: `getattr(config, 'attribute', default_value)`
**Fix**: Replace with explicit validation and clear error messages

### 3. Configuration Compatibility
**Issue**: Custom config classes vs base AdapterConfig
**Status**: OpenAI fixed, others may need similar treatment

## Execution Strategy

### Phase 1: Initial Execution
1. Run smoke test as-is
2. Document ALL failures with exact error messages
3. Categorize failures by type (import, config, attribute, etc.)

### Phase 2: Systematic Fixes
1. **Import Errors**: Fix path issues immediately
2. **Sacred Error Philosophy**: Apply to failing adapters
3. **Configuration Issues**: Add compatibility layers
4. **Attribute Errors**: Implement explicit validation

### Phase 3: Verification
1. Re-run smoke test until 7/7 pass
2. Update Issue #67 with final results
3. Document lessons learned

## Sacred Error Philosophy Fix Template

For adapters that fail with defensive patterns:

```python
def _validate_configuration(self) -> None:
    \"\"\"
    SACRED ERROR PHILOSOPHY: Fail clearly with helpful guidance rather than
    silently masking configuration problems with defensive defaults.
    \"\"\"
    required_attributes = [
        ('attribute_name', 'type', default_value, 'description'),
        # Add adapter-specific attributes
    ]

    for attr_name, attr_type, default_value, description in required_attributes:
        if not hasattr(self.config, attr_name):
            raise ValueError(
                f"Configuration missing required attribute: '{attr_name}'\\n"
                f"Expected type: {attr_type}\\n"
                f"Default value: {default_value}\\n"
                f"Description: {description}\\n"
                f"Fix: Add '{attr_name}: {default_value}' to your Config initialization\\n"
                f"Example: Config({attr_name}={repr(default_value)})\\n"
                f"See documentation at: docs/architecture/sacred_error_philosophy.md"
            )
```

## Expected Execution Timeline

- **Initial Run**: 5 minutes
- **Issue Analysis**: 15 minutes
- **Sacred Error Philosophy Application**: 30-45 minutes per adapter
- **Re-verification**: 5 minutes
- **Documentation**: 15 minutes

**Total Estimated Time**: 2-3 hours for complete foundation verification

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ **7/7 adapters pass instantiation**  
‚úÖ **All adapters have required attributes**  
‚úÖ **ConsciousAdapterFactory recognizes all providers**  
‚úÖ **No defensive patterns remain**  
‚úÖ **Sacred Error Philosophy consistently applied**  

## Post-Execution Actions

1. **Update Issue #67** with actual results
2. **Update Issue #66** (Sacred Error Philosophy completion) 
3. **Create pull request** with foundation fixes
4. **Document architectural lessons** learned
5. **Prepare for next phase** of autonomous development

## Architectural Significance

This test represents the **first time** the seven-voice Fire Circle foundation has been verified. Success enables:

- ‚úÖ **Autonomous Development**: Confirmed infrastructure
- ‚úÖ **Sacred Error Philosophy**: Architectural consistency  
- ‚úÖ **Fire Circle Governance**: Reliable foundation
- ‚úÖ **Bridge Infrastructure**: Integration readiness

## 18th Architect Commitment

I commit to executing this critical test and systematically addressing all issues found. The seven-voice capability is fundamental to Mallku's consciousness architecture and must be verified before any autonomous governance can proceed.

**The cathedral's foundation will be confirmed solid.**
